Hide









This proposal outlines ongoing and future work pertaining to the development and characterization of quantum devices. The suggested methodologies borrow ideas and rely on techniques from quantum information theory. Specifically, four projects are discussed: developing single-site rotations in a Penning trap as a scalable mode of quantum computation, enabling large-scale quantum optimization in a neutral atom trap, benchmarking quantum computers with a quantum error detecting code, and bounding the integrated quantum Fisher information for metrological protocols. The first two projects are experimental collaborations working towards quantum computation with hundreds of qubits. The last two projects work towards developing theory to benchmark quantum computers and build quantum sensors. The first project is using an electromagnetic trap to confine ions, and perform manipulations on individual ions in the trap. These in turn will enable the use of the trap as a quantum computer. The second project involves developing algorithms for solving combinatorial optimization problems using a classical computer in tandem with a quantum computer. This research considers the particular case of hundreds of qubits, with noisy and slow measurements. The third project is continuing to develop an error detecting code that can be used to encode one logical qubit into four physical qubits. The proposed work provides a method for demonstrating genuine quantum error correction, as well as developing benchmarks for noisy quantum computers. Finally, the last project discusses developing theoretical bounds on a quantity in quantum information theory. By deriving these bounds, we will be able to build quantum sensors that are maximally sensitive over a range of frequencies.

Hide









Quantum optical communications is an emerging space-based technology that could potentially increase the information capacity of communications networks significantly and provide fundamentally secure communication links between trusted nodes within the network using Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). The Deep Space Quantum Link (DSQL) will develop the  technology to perform pioneering experiments on gravitational effects on quantum systems, test the basic assumptions of quantum theory, and demonstrate QKD at deep space distances.  The scientific objectives of the DSQL is to test the coupling of General Relativity, the physics most often associated with cosmology, with Quantum Field Theory, the physics of wave-like particles.  The DSQL will perform three experiments. Experiment A will study the effects of different inertial reference frames on Quantum Teleportation from the DSG to the ISS or to the ground. Experiment B will test for violations of Bell's inequality using quantum teleportation to lunar distances, more than two orders of magnitude longer than previous tests. Experiment C will establish a simple quantum communication link from the DSG to the ISS or to ground stations and evaluate the influence of a curved space time on communications. A Science Definition Team (SDT) was recently selected to aid JPL/NASA in determining the science objectives for the DSQL and the key technologies required for its implementation. The SDT consists of members from University of Illinois, Harvey-Mudd College, University of Maryland, University of Toronto, Canada, and University of Bremen, Germany. The SDT will also draw on expertise as needed from interested researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Max Planck Institute, Germany, University of Ulm, Germany, Leibniz University, Germany, and the National university of Singapore.
