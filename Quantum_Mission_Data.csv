0,Characterizing Quantum Devices Using the Principles of Quantum Information,"This proposal outlines ongoing and future work pertaining to the development and characterization of quantum devices. The suggested methodologies borrow ideas and rely on techniques from quantum information theory. Specifically, four projects are discussed: developing single-site rotations in a Penning trap as a scalable mode of quantum computation, enabling large-scale quantum optimization in a neutral atom trap, benchmarking quantum computers with a quantum error detecting code, and bounding the integrated quantum Fisher information for metrological protocols. The first two projects are experimental collaborations working towards quantum computation with hundreds of qubits. The last two projects work towards developing theory to benchmark quantum computers and build quantum sensors. The first project is using an electromagnetic trap to confine ions, and perform manipulations on individual ions in the trap. These in turn will enable the use of the trap as a quantum computer. The second project involves developing algorithms for solving combinatorial optimization problems using a classical computer in tandem with a quantum computer. This research considers the particular case of hundreds of qubits, with noisy and slow measurements. The third project is continuing to develop an error detecting code that can be used to encode one logical qubit into four physical qubits. The proposed work provides a method for demonstrating genuine quantum error correction, as well as developing benchmarks for noisy quantum computers. Finally, the last project discusses developing theoretical bounds on a quantity in quantum information theory. By deriving these bounds, we will be able to build quantum sensors that are maximally sensitive over a range of frequencies.

1,Quantum Pathways Institute,"The University of Texas at Austin will lead the Quantum Pathways Institute, focused on advancing quantum sensing technology for next-generation Earth science applications. Such technology would enable new understanding of our planet and the effects of climate change.  Quantum sensors use quantum physics principles to potentially collect more precise data and enable unprecedented science measurements. These sensors could be particularly useful for satellites in orbit around Earth to collect mass change data – a type of measurement that can tell scientists about how ice, oceans, and land water are moving and changing. Though the basic physics and technology for quantum sensors have been proven in concept, work is required to develop quantum sensors at the precisions necessary for next-generation science needs during spaceflight missions. The institute will work to further advance the physics underlying quantum sensors, design how these sensors could be built for space missions and understand how mission design and systems engineering would need to adapt to accommodate this new technology.

2,Toward Universal Quantum Optimal Photonic Processing Using Quantum Computation,"An efficient general encoding scheme for transferring photonic quantum states to physical quantum memories would provide a physical realization of quantum optimal receiver designs, whose performance can achieve orders of magnitude improvement over current communications and sensing technologies. The objective of this proposal is to develop such an encoding scheme through investigating novel light-matter Hamiltonians, like the Jaynes-Cumming Hamiltonian, the non-Gaussian Kerr-like gate Hamiltonian, among others. This investigation will be followed by in depth physical modeling of the performance when such schemes are applied to quantum optimal receiver designs, and optimization based on results. Many of the quantum optimal receiver designs have been developed by NASA for application to deep space quantum communications in the low-photon number regime. Their physical realization would provide access to highly efficient laser communications systems for future NASA missions. The realization of this photonic quantum state encoding receiver would also prove highly valuable for entanglement enhanced long baseline astronomy, as well as sensitive earth and planetary science observations, maximizing the ability to extract available information from incoming light. Outside of NASA, this technology also has many cross-over possibilities, as quantum efficient sensing and communication would prove greatly useful to humanity.

			(DSQL)","Quantum optical communications is an emerging space-based technology that could potentially increase the information capacity of communications networks significantly and provide fundamentally secure communication links between trusted nodes within the network using Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). The Deep Space Quantum Link (DSQL) will develop the  technology to perform pioneering experiments on gravitational effects on quantum systems, test the basic assumptions of quantum theory, and demonstrate QKD at deep space distances.  The scientific objectives of the DSQL is to test the coupling of General Relativity, the physics most often associated with cosmology, with Quantum Field Theory, the physics of wave-like particles.  The DSQL will perform three experiments. Experiment A will study the effects of different inertial reference frames on Quantum Teleportation from the DSG to the ISS or to the ground. Experiment B will test for violations of Bell's inequality using quantum teleportation to lunar distances, more than two orders of magnitude longer than previous tests. Experiment C will establish a simple quantum communication link from the DSG to the ISS or to ground stations and evaluate the influence of a curved space time on communications. A Science Definition Team (SDT) was recently selected to aid JPL/NASA in determining the science objectives for the DSQL and the key technologies required for its implementation. The SDT consists of members from University of Illinois, Harvey-Mudd College, University of Maryland, University of Toronto, Canada, and University of Bremen, Germany. The SDT will also draw on expertise as needed from interested researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Max Planck Institute, Germany, University of Ulm, Germany, Leibniz University, Germany, and the National university of Singapore.

4,On-Chip Quantum Repeater in Diamond for Space-Based Quantum Communication,"The focus of my research is on the optical properties of diamond. A diamond is composed of a crystal arrangement of carbon atoms and it is this structure that gives it strong mechanical forces along a single crystal direction. Due to this structure, diamonds mechanical properties have been the center of much research in materials science and mechanical engineering for much of the past century. However, in the past two decades, optical scientists have also discovered another use for the diamond. Due to the same mechanical property explained above, when a nitrogen substitution defect is in diamond, it also remains very stable. It is this stable, nitrogen impurity in diamond that will be the center of my investigations. Atomic physicists have been pioneering the work in manipulating atoms for applications in quantum communication. Quantum communication comprises of three major components: transportation (via photons), storage (via nuclear spins or atoms), and processing (via microwaves) of information. Though many of the major processes for this vision have been experimentally realized in the last two decades on individual atoms, much more work remains to be done to culminate in a quantum communication protocol. The optical state of the nitrogen atom, such as its energy levels, can be accessed and read out by illumination and detection of photons. The single nitrogen impurity atom is essentially well trapped by the crystal lattice of carbons, and allows for convenient investigation without the need for building a complex apparatus for trapping a single atom. The first stage of my research will be to controllably write to and read out of highly stable nitrogen impurities in diamond to act as a quantum memory node or also a highly sensitive magnetometer. The memory node being the state of the atom, and the sensitive magnetometer being from how environmental conditions, such as an applied magnetic or electric field, affect the read-out of the nitrogen impurity. One specific application to which I will be working towards is an in-situ method of measuring the electric pulses of neurons in mice using nanometer-sized diamonds. These nanodiamonds would potentially be useful for the live-imaging of neural activity of biological systems in space. The guiding and manipulating of light on a compact chip is known as integrated optics. In the second stage of my research, I aim to engineer structures onto diamond solids or other materials such that light can be guided into and out of the nitrogen impurity for optical manipulation in a compact and scalable manner. This would fully implement the diamond impurity as a quantum repeater to enable quantum communication over even further distances. Quantum communication through space has also recently been laid in two ways. The first step was taken by scientists at NASAs Goddard Space Flight Research Center. In the past decade, they began implementing optical, rather than microwave communication hardware which has enabled about 100 times faster data communication rates between much of the space based instruments under NASAs direction. This upgrade has been popularly likened to NASAs internet going from a dial-up modem to todays high-speed fiber optic based internet speeds. The second step has been taken by physicists that have demonstrated entanglement over a distance of 144km through space. As communication moves to, and will probably remain, in the optical regime, quantum communication will grow more and more relevant to NASAs communication technologies. I have thus listed two major applications for diamond in this proposal: neurobiology and quantum communication. Without a doubt, both fields will play an important role in the next stage of NASAs endeavor for space exploration.

5,Diamond Quantum Memory,"As quantum systems for information processing and communication continue to grow in size and complexity, novel methods of transferring and storing quantum information are needed. Quantum memory elements must retain quantum information much longer than their processing counterparts, transfer information quickly and efficiently to and from processing and flying qubits, be capable of heralding entanglement and teleportation events across a quantum network, and be scalable to large numbers of qubits. Hybrid mechanical systems, which use mechanical oscillators to control and connect quantum elements, are poised to fulfill just such a role and have grown in prominence in recent years due to their ability to couple to a wide variety of quantum systems and the number of practical advantages mechanical systems have over their photonic analogues. Furthermore, optomechanical crystal (OMC) devices, which leverage interactions between light and mechanical motion, have demonstrated many of the requirements for quantum memories. We seek to build upon previous efforts at implementing an OMC quantum memory by using diamond as a host material and coupling our diamond OMCs to a highly-coherent silicon-vacancy center spin as a long-lived quantum memory element. By adding this additional memory component and using diamond as our host material, we aim to develop a quantum memory and quantum communication platform that is resistant to optical absorption heating that has plagued silicon implementations and which can be scaled up and integrated into large-scale quantum networks.

6,A diamond nanophotonics platform for quantum communication with multiplexed qubit repeaters,"The world of quantum mechanics offers new mechanisms for communication, computation, and sensing. Quantum networks enable the transmission of quantum information over long distances by first distributing entanglement across many quantum repeaters, and then using this entanglement as a resource for state teleportation. Reports of the first memory-based quantum repeater node that beats direct photon transmission between two points has set the stage for the development of a quantum internet of connected quantum repeaters, computers, and sensors.  High speed, long range transfer of quantum information can be achieved by multiplexing many memory-assisted quantum repeater nodes. With their efficient spin-photon interfaces and long coherence times, atomic defect qubits in diamond have become the leading solid state platform for this application. My research seeks to develop an all-in-one platform for electronic and photonic control of atomic memories in diamond. By integrating hundreds of quantum memories on one chip, I will enable scalable production of quantum repeater nodes with individually-manipulable qubits. These quantum repeater nodes can be joined into a quantum network capable of interconnecting ground stations, spacecraft, and satellites, with implications for precision navigation and timing, secure data transfer, and distributed computing. Moreover, quantum networks can be used to drastically extend the baseline for large-aperture astronomical interferometry, enabling higher imaging resolution than ever before.

7,Ultra-narrow Linewidth Lasers for Deployed Quantum Timing Applications,"Vescent Photonics, LLC (Vescent) in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory (MIT-LL) proposes to develop a compact ultra-narrow linewidth laser based on photonic integrated chip (PIC) technology for next-generation fieldable quantum sensor applications including optical atomic clocks, two-way time transfer, and precision inertial force and gravity sensing. Atomic clocks represent the most precise and accurate instruments developed by scientists to date and enable applications including the measurement of weak gravitational fields in near-zero gravity as well as accurate positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) onboard a spacecraft. However, high-performance optical atomic clocks, including Sr+ trapped-ion clocks, currently only exist in laboratory settings due to constraints on the size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) and environmental susceptibility of critical technology subsystems. One of the key subsystems so far hindering the transition of these high-performance optical clocks outside the laboratory is the ultra-narrow-linewidth (< 100 Hz) laser required to interrogate the atoms. The solution proposed here for the development of an ultra-narrow linewidth laser is an extension to the initial demonstrations by Dr. William Loh at MIT-LL with fiber-based stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) lasers which have been demonstrated in an operating Sr+ trapped-ion clock, resulting in an ADEV of 3.9E-14/(Tau)^(0.5). Using these fiber-based results as a baseline, recent measurements conducted by the MIT-LL team have shown an evolution toward PIC-based waveguide cavities that can support ultranarrow-linewidth lasers via SBS. The effort proposed here seeks to integrate necessary chip-scale components to move towards a design where the entire ultra-narrow-linewidth laser system is contained on a chip-scale device.

8,Ultra-Efficient Integrated Photonic Quantum Transceiver for High-Speed Quantum Communications,"This program will develop a new class of 'on-a-chip' quantum transceivers that can operate at T ~ 250K range with performance meeting NASA's needs for secure ultra-high-speed data free-space communications for future aerospace applications. Ground-to-satellite and satellite-to-satellite quantum encrypted communications, distributed sensing, and networking demand a disruptive ‘on-a-chip’ technology that permits ultra-efficient, high-speed entangled-photon generation and single-photon detection packaged to provide low size, weight, power, and cost. The program integrates technology developed by both the University of California, Santa Barbara, (UCSB) and Amethyst. The UCSB Team has demonstrated a <0.4 dB/cm loss AlGaAs-on-insulator photonics platform for entangled-photon pair generation. Signal rates >10 GHz/mW2 have been demonstrated—at least 100X faster than all other approaches and 10,000X faster than silicon integrated-photonic sources. Waveguide-integrated superconducting single-photon detectors have also been demonstrated with sub-40 ps timing jitter, sub-milli-Hertz dark count rates, unity quantum efficiency, and -40 dB crosstalk. The Amethyst team has demonstrated InGaAs/InP single-photon avalanche detectors (SPADs) capable of >100 MHz bandwidth at 250 K by using gating and proprietary bulk defect passivation techniques. By integrating these source and detector technologies, the program will develop a high-speed quantum transceiver with an entangled-photon source and on-chip photonic conditioning components (transmitter) and photonic interferometric circuits with waveguide-integrated single-photon detectors (receiver). This ‘on-a-chip’ quantum transceiver will be capable of uncompromised 'qubit' detection. The Phase I program will deliver an emitter and detector device at TRL 4.

10,Quantum Limits of Inertial Sensors,"This proposal aims at the highest performance inertial instrument for space navigation. More specifically, achieving a sensitivity for these instruments beyond the quantum limits fits ideally the critical needs of NASA for improved onboard autonomous navigation technologies, to support the next generation space missions. The final instruments will be based on mode-locked fiber lasers in the cavity of which two pulses circulate; a linear cavity for the accelerometer, a ring for the gyroscope. In both cases, the response to rotation or acceleration is a beat frequency between the two frequency combs corresponding to each of the circulating pulses. While in the ring laser the gyro response is proportional to the linear dimensions, the beat frequency response of the accelerometer is inversely proportional to the linear dimensions. The accelerometer will benefit from miniaturization (integrated optics), while the gyroscope can be made of a fiber ring laser covering a large area (still a very small volume). The scientific challenge involves devising new methods to (i) enhance the response (i.e. a larger beat frequency for the same rotation rate or acceleration) and (ii) reducing the noise below the quantum limit. Fiber lasers do not have the flexibility to act as model systems needed for this basic investigation. Therefore, we will initiate the research with discrete component lasers - specifically optical parametric oscillators, synchronously pumped by a Ti:sapphire laser. The first operation will be to eliminate all sources of mechanical noise until the quantum noise limit has been achieved (and identified). Next, different means of noise squeezing will be attempted. One method involves the use of a degenerate optical parametric oscillator. Another method involves interfering a soliton (with noise characteristic deformed by Kerr effect) with a dispersed pulse. Once the most successful noise reduction scheme has been identified, it will be applied to a fiber system in a linear and ring cavity.

12,Integration of a semiconductor quantum emitter and a lithium niobate frequency converter for telecom quantum light generation,"Generation of quantum light deterministically and at telecommunications wavelengths has been an insurmountable challenge for execution of quantum networking protocols in a scalable manner, as telecom photons can travel with minimal loss through optical fiber networks, distributing quantum entanglement over long distances. Semiconductor quantum dots have emerged as the most promising platform to generate entangled photons deterministically, enabling scalable quantum networking applications. However, high quality quantum dots operate at wavelengths outside of the telecom bandwidth, and therefore, efficient and low-noise quantum frequency converters are needed to use these quantum emitters for quantum networking purposes. To date, fiber-coupled deterministic entangled photon sources with high efficiency have not been demonstrated, not even at wavelengths other than telecom. This proposal focuses on developing such a source based on quantum dots, coupled to a frequency converter to enable low-loss fiber communications. The focus of this Phase I project is to show the feasibility of developing fiber-coupled quantum emitters and frequency converters separately, and the feasibility for their integration. High-quality-factor optical cavities will be designed and fabricated that, when coupled to quantum dots, ensure efficient extraction of the quantum dot emission into a single-mode fiber. During a separate effort, the feasibility of a frequency converter will be studied, based on a material with ultra-low loss and high nonlinear coefficient, periodically poled thin-film lithium niobate. Thin-film lithium niobate has emerged as a promising platform for integrated quantum photonics, supporting functionalities such as low-loss routing, high-speed switching, and nonlinear quantum processes. Together with high-quality-factor optical cavities, the feasibility of deterministic generation of entangled photon pairs at telecom wavelengths will be shown during Phase I.

13,Near-term quantum computing for applications,"From habitat automation to navigation and scheduling of tasks to networking, the challenges of modern space exploration are as much computational as they are aeronautical. Effective space exploration requires autonomous systems to maximize the utility of a mission that is subject to limited resources. Quantum computing holds great potential for helping NASA to advance the frontier of space exploration by solving larger problems more quickly, with higher quality solutions. Because quantum computing is such a young technology, exploiting that potential as soon as possible requires identifying the most promising applications and developing application-specific techniques that fully utilize small-scale hardware, as well as steering hardware development towards those applications. I propose an integrated, multi-faceted research program that pushes forward the state of the art in near-term quantum computing for applications by exploiting the synergy between three candidate quantum computing platforms: quantum annealing (QA), quantum approximate optimization algorithm, and networks of optical parametric oscillators (OPOs). First, I will map problems related to Air Traffic Management and planning the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy to the formalism used by quantum computers. Second, I will address the current challenge in implementing QA and QAOA due to hardware constraints by designing application-specific techniques for compiling higher level algorithms to low-level hardware. Third, I will utilize previous work on assessing the quantumness and performance of quantum annealers to answer analogous questions for OPOs. Lastly, I will design and implement error-correction schemes for quantum annealing based on continuous measurement and feedback. Addressing QA, QAOA, and OPOs together enables a more robust characterization of their relative strengths and weakness, as well as the extraction of general principles applicable to all near-term quantum computing efforts. This unification will accelerate progress towards near-term quantum computing for applications.

14,Optical Frequency Synthesizer for Quantum Applications,"Vescent Photonics, LLC (Vescent) proposes to develop a compact, low-power, environmentally robust optical fiber frequency comb (OFC) that operates in the visible spectrum (400-800 nm) and is constructed from telecommunications (telecom) components to enable next-generation space-deployed optical atomic clocks and Rydberg-atom based quantum sensors. The proposed system will meet the challenging performance requirements for state-of-the-art quantum sensors and clocks while maintaining a low size, weight, and power (SWaP) in a configurable platform that can be adapted to the diverse needs for several of the key space-deployed applications described in Focus Area S16.08. For example, optical atomic clocks can offer instabilities as low as 4.8x10-17 in a second, opening myriad possibilities for precision sensors addressing NASA’s core interests including accurate positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) onboard a spacecraft as well as the measurement of weak gravitational fields in near-zero gravity. Rydberg-atom based quantum sensors offer similarly dramatic improvements for electric field and microwave measurements. However, the most promising optical atomic clock platforms (e.g., Sr and Yb lattice clocks and Sr+ and Yb+ trapped ion clocks) and Rydberg-atom based sensor platforms can only operate reliably in laboratory environments, largely due to their reliance on the environmentally susceptible, high-SWaP infrastructure required to frequency stabilize multiple lasers across the visible and near-infrared spectral regions. OFCs are an ideal substitute that can significantly reduce both SWaP and complexity of the optical atomic clock or quantum sensor. However, there is a clear and critical gap in field-deployable, low-SWaP, visible OFCs. Our proposed solution exploits rugged nonlinear micro-optic modules in telecom-style packaging to synthesize arbitrary visible frequencies from Vescent’s existing radiation-hardened, environmentally robust OFC.

15,Atomic System for Quantum Secure Communications,"In the next decade, quantum technologies will provide revolutionary advances in communications, sensing and metrology, information processing, timekeeping, and navigation. Of particular interest to this NASA solicitation is the transformative potential of quantum technology in the realm of communications. Furthermore, transmission of quantum information over arbitrary distances raises new possibilities in sensing, networked clocks, and distributed quantum computation. The entanglement distribution at the heart of all these applications relies on the same underlying “quantum repeater” technology. ColdQuanta’s objective in this Phase II SBIR is to produce a critical enabling quantum repeater component: a long-lived quantum memory that is strongly coupled to optical fields for storage and recall of single photons. During Phase I, ColdQuanta investigated generation of atomic ensembles with ultra-high optical density (OD>100) for generation and storage of quantum information because high OD is critical for attaining high memory efficiency. However, the residual atomic motion in the Phase I ensemble results in dephasing of the quantum memory on a timescale of several microseconds, rather than the many milliseconds required for long-range quantum networking. Nevertheless, the Phase I study demonstrated ColdQuanta’s ability to produce high OD ensembles of cold atoms to boost memory efficiency. The remaining task, proposed for Phase II, is to modify the Phase I atom ensemble generation scheme by trapping the atoms in an optical lattice, which limits residual motion and therefore motional dephasing allowing memory lifetimes up to 0.3 seconds to be observed. Development and fabrication of the photon-coupled quantum memory system in Phase II will be highly efficient because the system can be produced by minor modification of ColdQuanta’s existing DoubleMOT commercial product, which comprises the vacuum cell, magnetics, and optics needed to produce cold atom ensembles.

16,Atomic System for Quantum Secure Communications,"The future of secure ground-space and space-space communications relies on development of quantum secure communications (QSC) systems. ColdQuanta proposes to develop QSC devices based on compact, robust vacuum systems containing dense ensembles of cold, trapped rubidium atoms. In particular, we propose to develop a source of high-flux, high-coherence entangled photon pairs (biphotons). These biphotons can be used to transmit information in a provably secure manner that is consistent with existing QKD protocols and other real-time secure information transfer protocols. The proposed atomically sourced biphotons outperform photon pairs from existing solid-state sources by over a factor of 1000 in coherence time and spectral linewidth. The narrow spectral linewidth of the atomically sourced biphotons makes them compatible with direct interfacing with downstream atomic systems, opening vast new vistas in the potential for long-range QSC and quantum networking. A second direction that further pushes the state-of-the-art in highly-coherent quantum optical systems for QSC is our second proposed device that provides efficient storage and recall of single-photon states. The single photons are stored in a coherent collective excitation of a cold atomic ensemble and can later be retrieved when the downstream QSC system is ready. Together, these devices represent a dramatic step forward in the quality of commercially available QSC hardware components. Nevertheless, the parallel development of the devices will be highly efficient due to their shared reliance on identical underlying cold atom hardware. These devices (and potentially several other related quantum optical devices) will be different laser and optical packages wrapped around an identical vacuum system for production of atomic ensembles with extremely high optical density. Phase I will demonstrate the underlying atom ensemble hardware and will complete system-level designs of the proposed QSC hardware components.

17,Atomic System for Quantum Secure Communications,"Under this Phase II-Extension, ColdQuanta proposes to design and build the Quantum Atomic Lattice Module (QuALM), a compact 1064 nm optical lattice module for trapping an atom ensemble, and the Quantum Repeater Atomic Memory Module (QuRAMM), a 795 nm laser system used to print quantum information on an atomic ensemble for memory storage and retrieval. The modules will be integrated with the Quantum Cold Atom Laboratory (QuCAL) platform producing a research-grade quantum repeater system. Also integrated into the QuCAL will be the Phase II generated quantum memory physics package. All together the system will preserve and recall quantum information in the spin wave of a lattice-trapped atomic ensemble for quantum communication network applications. The complete system will be delivered to NASA for validation in an environment relevant to currently proposed future communication networks. The QuALM contains a 1064nm fiber laser with intensity and timing control used to confine the atom motion. This laser creates the coherence spin wave to store coherence information in the quantum memory. The QuRAMM will generate two hyperfine states resonant frequency components for writing and reading entangled information. To preserve the high fidelity of encoded quantum information, the module design will ensure the write and read pulses are phase coherent. Coherence phase locking or phase modulation techniques will be employed. QuALM will be able to support most optical dipole trap applications and QuRAMM will be able to support a wide variety of transition processes using the phase coherent laser pulses. Applications such as free-space atom accelerometers utilizing stimulated-Raman process, lattice-based gravimeters, and Ramsey-type atomic clocks can be enabled by simply replacing the laser diode to 780nm (or 852 nm for Cs) and shifting the electronically controlled laser lock frequency.

Since the circuit layout is built at the bottom of PV array, the circuits are densely laid out to reduce the internal resistance substantially. Again since silicon germanium compound has much broader bandgap structure than silicon alone, it can utilize more solar energy to free up valence band electrons. Structurally, the sapphire substrate surface of quantum-well PV cells is very strong and does not require any special protective coatings and frames to hold them. Therefore, the anticipated life of quantum-well PV cells is more than ten-times longer than Si PV cells. Summing up these advantages of quatum-well PV cells, the overall conversion efficiency would reach well beyond 35% and the energy density would be tripled as compared to the conventional PV cells. The overall cost factor would be 5 cents per kWh competitively.

19,Quantum-memory Wavelength-Division Multiplexing (QWDM),"Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) will develop integrated optical frequency shifters to enable Quantum-memory Wavelength-Division Multiplexing (QWDM). Our approach will enable the connection of multiple quantum memory registers across a free-space or fiber optical channel, increasing the bandwidth of near-term quantum networks by 10–100×. As most optical quantum memories operate at a single wavelength we cannot readily apply wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) techniques to increase the bandwidth of a quantum link. To overcome this challenge, we propose to utilize a high-efficiency frequency shifters at the transmitter to shift each quantum register within a memory unit onto a separate wavelength channel that we can combine using standard WDM techniques. After transmitting the multiplexed signal over a free-space or fiber link, a complimentary device at the receiver will de-multiplex the photons and a second set of frequency shifters will shift the wavelengths back to original native frequency of the quantum memory’s register. Within Phase I, we will design and demonstrate a compact on-chip, high-efficiency frequency shifter operating at a native quantum memory wavelength using an approach that can be readily adapted to any existing quantum memory configuration at visible and near-infrared wavelengths. These results, in conjunction with an architecture-design that can efficiently shift and route multiple photons to different registers within a quantum memory, will pave the way for the creation of a highly scalable quantum networks using QWDM.

20,"Quantum Entanglement and High Brightness Laser Source
		
			(OCR)","Our focus is on demonstrating high precision (sub-micron) laser ranging for Navigation using a unique high-sensitivity optical correlation receiver with both classical laser pulses and an entangled-photon laser transmitter. We used short-pulsed diode lasers with classical short pulses to demonstarte the receiver prototype.  We published this result at a recent conference: https://spie.org/Publications/Proceedings/Paper/10.1117/12.2225947?origin_id=x4325&start_volume_number=9800   and as a NASA Tech Brief:   http://www.techbriefs.com/component/content/article/ntb/tech-briefs/photonics-optics/24127   Our next steps are 1) to use femtosecond lasers for the classical light pulses.  2) to build an entangled photon sources laser transmitter 3) to test the laser ranging precision and trades with these two sources to achieve sub-micron ranging over large distances.1.             Abstract This is a new effort for the development of quantum technology and toward a world-class quantum entanglement demonstration.  We propose to develop a high brightness entangled photon source at 1064 nm using a nonlinear crystal.  The entangled photon laser transmitter and ultra-sensitive receiver permits high-precision over very large distance for orders of magnitude improvements to the Global Positioning System,  formation flying, gravity wave and field measurements and very long baseline interferometry. 2.            ObjectivesQuantum communications has recently matured from a purely fundamental research area of quantum physics to an applied science with a potentially huge economic impact.  The emergence of applications and technologies based on the foundations of quantum physics has revolutionized our understanding of information theory.  Quantum superposition and entanglement constitute a novel type of resources that enables new developments in the fields of communications, computation, and metrology.  All these quantum technology applications are based on the development of an efficient laser source for entangled pairs of photons.  This is a first and necessary step.  The overall technical objective is to demonstrate a practical use for quantum entanglement-based systems.  With an entangled photon source can pursue the following ideas: 1) quantum communication 2) precision laser ranging 3) space optical links for a world-wide network of ultra-precise clocks 4) quantum key distribution 5) improved imaging.  Our focus for this IRAD is on demonstrating high precision (sub-micron) laser ranging for Navigation using an entangled-photon transmitter and a unique optical correlation receiver. 3.            Justification NASA PracticalThe entangled photon laser transmitter and ultra-sensitive receiver permits high-precision (approaching fundamental limits) over very large distance for orders of magnitude improvements to the Global Positioning System,  formation flying, gravity wave and field measurements and very long baseline interferometry.   Our recent work on a correlation receiver provides a strong contribution to this field.  NASA Space Technology Research Fellowship (NSTRF) quantum optics PhD graduate student Timothy Rambo (Northwestern University)  (https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/strg/2012_class.html#.V6H402VgFhM) conducted this work at NASA-GSFC with Dr. Krainak in the summer of 2015.  We used short-pulsed diode lasers to work on the prototype.  Further work is needed with femtosecond lasers (already in-hand) and entangled photon sources (proposed here).  Our work (and need) for precision ranging differentiates us from and provides a complement to the US Department of Defense (DoD) efforts.NASA relation to US  University and DoD effortsOur plan is to cooperate with the US University and DoD efforts.  Dr. Krainak (NASA-GSFC 554) has maintained close and continuous contact with University of Maryland Joint Quantum Institute members: Dr. Alan Midgall (http://jqi.umd.edu/people/fellows), Dr. Joshua Bienfang & Dr. Alessandro Restelli (http://jqi.umd.edu/people/research-scientists).   Ardeshir Azarbarzin (560) under direction from Chris Scolese (NASA-GSFC 100) is establishing a connection to the Space and Naval Warfare Command http://www.public.navy.mil/spawar/Pages/default.aspxNASA relation to International effortsDr. Krainak has been in continuous contact with the Austrian quantum optics group that hopes to conduct a quantum entanglement experiment on the International Space Station. (http://www.iqoqi-vienna.at/home/research-groups/ursin-group/quantumopticsinspace/)Dr. Krainak traveled to their recent meeting at the European Space Technology Center to discuss possibly collaboration in supplying a NASA laser satellite-tracking ground station.  We have been conducting optical communications laser ground station experiments at the NASA-GSFC Geoscience and Geophysical Astronomical Observatory (GGAO) and at White Sands Complex.International competitionChina recently launched a satellite to conduct quantum communication experiments  http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2016-05/23/content_25421841.htm4.             Research and Development PlanA. Entangled photon laser transmitter:We propose to use a commercial of the shelf 532nm frequency doubling PPLN crystal (Thorlabs, Model SHG3-1 and SHG3-10) for parametric frequency down conversion.  The crystal will produce pairs of photons at 1064 nm when it is pumped by 532 nm laser.  We then use a polarization beam splitter to combine two orthogonal polarized beams.  Due to the uncertainty principal, the combined beam will be polarization entangled.  Figure 1 shows the proposed experiment setup.  We will perform polarization correlation test to demonstrate a violation of a Bell inequality using this entangled source.Figure 1. Entangled photon transmitterCoincidence detection rate will be recorded for various setting of polarizer angles.  In this case, we will only detect 50% of the entangled pairs because paired photon could both transmit through the beam splitter to APD A or to APD B.  The  Bell’s inequality test is the quantum optics standard for verifying photon entanglement and quantifying entanglement quality.  The density matrix of its state will also be analyzed using quantum state tomography (QST).Figure 2. Simple entangled photon test systemB. Practical, High Signal-to-Noise Ratio Entangled photon receiverNanometer ranging with an intensity interferometer (eliminates sensitivity to vibration and need for expensive optics) with a single photon sensitive receiver can be achieved[1]. This work recently received an SPIE Best Paper Award.  We previously demonstrated a proof-of-concept optical correlation receiver that has been shown[2] to provide excellent results for entangled photons.   We constructed a fourth-order interferometer using beam splitters and quarter-wave plates as shown in Figure 3.  Both beamsplitters are polarizing. The pulsed light source was a Picoquant 780 nm wavelength laser diode with a 70 ps pulse width and 2.5 nm spectral width (360 fs coherence time).  The detectors are silicon avalanche photodiode arrays (Sensl Model MicroFC-SMA-10010) with an on-chip high-pass filtered output that provides good photon number resolution.  A random phase is introduced in one beam (e.g. with a moving mirror driven by a piezo-electric-transducer (PZT). We used an oscilloscope to subtract the outputs of the two detector arrays (directly measuring I 1 (t) – I 2 (t)). We measured the variance of the difference of detector outputs over 10,000 optical pulses at each micrometer position to ensure the average phase induced by the PZT was 0.  The experimentally observed fourth-order correlation peak and the theory are shown in Figure 4.  In this IRAD we will use this optical correlation receiver to integrate entangled-photons to provide sub-micron laser ranging over long distance. Figure 3. Fourth-order correlator proof-of-concept experiment.  Both beamsplitters are polarizing.Figure 4.  Normalized fourth-order correlator experimental and theoretical resultC.

21,Photonic and Quantum Interactions of Atomic-Scale Junctions,"In this proposal, the fundamental quantum and photonic interactions of bimetallic atomic-scale junctions (ASJs) will be explored, with three major space technology-related applications in focus: 1) chemical sensing, 2) smart/metamaterials, and 3) memristor-based computing. An ASJ is a type of quantum-point contact, created by electrochemically depositing silver between two nanoscale electrodes. This connection can be formed and destroyed by applying the appropriate voltage potential across the electrodes, and thus controlled to the point where the junction narrows to the width of a single atom. At this point, the junction can exhibit a phenomenon known as quantized conductance.  In this region, the junction is especially sensitive to disturbances in the surrounding environment. Previous research has demonstrated the potential of a single ASJ in sensing chemicals bound to the junction at this narrowest section; this proposal will extend on that work by examining parallel and serial arrays of ASJs for chemical sensing and memristive computing, as well as the interaction of the junctions in 3-dimensional configurations with light for metamaterials. The objectives of this project are to establish control over junction growth in massively parallel arrays both through direct electrical contact and with photo-induced charging, then utilize this control to examine the potential application of these junctions in the areas described above. Junctions will be created using electrochemical deposition between conductive electrodes, which may be lithographically-defined macroscale electrodes on a wafer, a conductive AFM tip, or nanoparticles stimulated with focused lasers. Achieving these objectives would be highly significant to both NASA and the community at large. Due to the junctions' small space and weight, a massively parallel array of junctions would not take up more than a few square millimeters of area on a silicon wafer yet could perform a wide array of functions; thus, they are ideally suited to the tight weight and size requirements of terrestrially-launched space missions. The applications of ASJs in chemical sensing and memristor-based neural network applications could allow for new experiments and data analysis not possible with existing technology. In addition, the fundamental insights into quantum and photonic phenomena gained by devices that operate at room-temperature and under simple conditions would also greatly benefit the scientific community and science education.

22,Quantum Light Source for On-Site Detector Calibration,"Ongoing R&D into quantum computing, quantum communications, and quantum networking solutions requires optical detectors that can detect a single photon with high efficiency. For many experiments, it is critical to know the precise detection efficiency of these detectors. Calibrating these detectors is currently a challenge as these detector are often large, complex, and fragile and must be shipped to a calibration facility for measurement. We propose an alternate method of detector calibration that permits on-site detector calibration using a small, rugged quantum bi-photon source. These bi-photon sources can be used with a calibration method previously reported and demonstrated by NIST (the Klyshko method). As part of our proposed Phase I project, a proof-of-principle demonstration of the Klyshko calibration method will be implemented using a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) bi-photon source offered by Qubitekk. The calibration accuracy achievable with this non-optimized COTS source will be demonstrated and documented. This COTS source design will then serve as the starting point for an optimized, enhanced stability, prototype bi-photon source for on-site detector calibration. The performance improvements of this prototype source design will be estimated through optical modeling and experimental measurements and compared against the COTS source specs and testing data. The suitability of the prototype for various environments (both space-based and terrestrial) will be evaluated through modeling and comparison with prior testing data. The ability of the prototype source to characterize SPD efficiency across a broad wavelength spectrum will be evaluated and any spectral gaps or range limitations identified. The design and anticipated performance improvements related to this prototype, optimized bi-photon source will be detailed in the project’s final report and its construction and testing proposed as part of any follow-on Phase II effort.

23,Single Photon Generation by Functionalized Quantum Dots on Carbon Nanotube Arrays for Single Photon Detector Calibration and Quantum Entanglement Applications,"Generation of single photons is of great interest to NASA for several applications, chief among them is for calibration of single photon sensing detectors such as superconducting edge sensors or nanowire detectors. Single photon sources that produces photons that are entangled are also needed for quantum communications. The development of a carbon nanotube electrode by the SBIR firm during unrelated SBIR Phase III work related to an E-Nose for detection of VOC's in COVID-19 infected patients, provides a new avenue for the development of single photon sources. By implanting functionalized quantum dots (QD) on activated carbon nanotube (CNT) sites we can generate single photons by three different processes. 1) Electrical stimulation of quantum dots embedded in a dielectric 2) Optical stimulation using a laser of a different wavelength 3) Opto-electric stimulation of the quantum dots by providing a bias voltage and then providing optical pumping. The use of CNTs as both the support structure and electrode provides an ultra dark background for absorbing light from the pump laser to allow easier viewing of the emitted photon. CNTs freely share electrons within their matrix, also making them appear as an electron gas, which may also enhance the QD photon generation pump process. The QD's will be implanted using a nano plotter on an array of 16 pixels that are derived from the E-Nose chip design, this could allow for the implantation of a variety of QD types to provide different colors of emitted photons from each pixel. During Phase I will focus on demonstrating that we can generate single photons by these modalities. A pump laser will be passed through a fast optical fiber switch and collimated to illuminate the pixel array; the 1x2 switch will be operated to allow the illumination and collected photons to be isolated, with the emitted photons captured by the collimator array and output by the fiber switch to a fast detector for measurement.

24,"Quantum Calorimeters Based on HgCdTe Alloys, Phase I","NASA's next generation of x-ray observation missions require x-ray calorimeters with superior energy resolution. Semimetallic HgTe has already proven itself as an excellent soft x-ray absorber material due to its low heat capacity. The alloy Hg0.834Cd0.166Te is predicted to also have zero energy gap at T=0 K and a heat capacity even less that that of HgTe due to: (i) a greater Debye temperature (resulting in a lower lattice heat capacity), and (ii) a smaller electron effective mass (resulting in a lower electronic heat capacity). Thus Hg0.834Cd0.166Te-based microcalorimeter arrays are expected to have an energy resolution superior to that of HgTe-based ones. We propose the growth of single crystal Hg0.834Cd0.166Te layers by molecular beam epitaxy on Si substrates. Mercury vacancies will be filled after growth to reduce the possibility of them acting as acceptors and introducing a significant electronic heat capacity. The Hg0.834Cd0.166Te layers will be characterized by x-ray diffraction to asses their structural quality and crystallinity, FTIR mapping to confirm the uniformity of their energy gaps and alloy compositions, Hall measurements to assess their electrical transport properties, etch pit density counts to determine dislocation densities, transmission electron microscopy to determine microscopic structural information, and heat capacity measurements at mK temperatures to test their promise as high energy resolution quantum calorimeters.

25,Quantum Effect Materials and Devices for Future Communication Systems,"NanoSonic proposes to design, fabricate and demonstrate the performance of optical detectors that use multiple quantum material effects to overcome fundamental microelectronic device limits. Through prior research, NanoSonic has fabricated single-element optical detectors and theoretically and investigated several quantum material behaviors separately. Here we would combine these technologies into a single device to serve as a ""pathfinder"" for future quantum materials research and product development. NanoSonic would work with researchers in the Department of Physics at Virginia Tech, and microelectronics scientists at a major US electronics company to analyze and build the devices, and demonstrate the quantum principals on which they are based. Our proposed prototype detectors will incorporate the following quantum effects. - Sub-quantum electron transport associated with ballistic electron transport leading to decreased conductor resistances and thermal losses, and in part overcomes Moore's Law - Resonant sub-optical wavelength antennas that treat incoming optical signals as waves instead of photons - Metal nanocluster surface plasmon resonance effects to increase detector efficiency - Tunable bandgap quantum dot detectors that exhibit Multiple Electron Generation effects and quantum efficiencies QE>1 NanoSonic has investigated and published observations of the basic physics of some of these effects. During Phase I we would design, fabricate, test and deliver first-generation materials and devices to NASA, and work with electronics company device engineers to consider how these technologies may be transitioned to future communication system hardware.

26,Making quantum computers less noisy and more useful,"Quantum computing in theory has strong potential to become a viable technology for certain computational problems. However, quantum computers in practice are severely limited by noise. Noise occurs due to interactions with stray particles and imperfect implementations of logic gates. Too much noise effectively destroys quantum properties like superposition and entanglement that algorithms use to achieve speedups. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop quantum computing as a viable technology to solve difficult optimization problems in aeronautics and space exploration. The specific task in pursuit of this goal is to develop techniques to mitigate noise in current quantum computers and make them more useful such problems of practical interest.  This will be accomplished by developing software for quantum compiling and extending theoretical methods for near-term quantum error correction. Our methodology for quantum compiling is device-specific and will lead to finely-tuned algorithms designed to counteract the noise properties of specific quantum computers. Our software framework also utilizes fast heuristic methods for initial qubit routing as well as optionality for """"uncompiling,"""" a novel technique which intentionally introduces small algorithmic errors to drastically reduce hardware errors. Additionally, we will extend and improve recent theoretical methods for """"near-term quantum error correction"""" by using error correcting codes specifically tailored to current devices. These techniques will be evaluated by quantifying the improved performance when applied to practical optimization problems relevant for Earth and space sciences, mission planning, and pattern recognition.  Our proposed research is directly responsive to Technology Roadmap TA11.4: Information Processing. The techniques we develop will maximize the utility of near-term quantum computers, making them more viable as an information processing paradigm for hard computational problems. The combinatorial optimization problems we test these techniques on are directly relevant for searching, routing, and exploration tasks of interest to the mission of NASA. Our research will help to make quantum computing a transformative technology with positive impacts for NASA and the nation.

These assessments will further test their promise as high energy resolution quantum calorimeters and will help optimize material and processing parameters. The thermal property measurements will be performed on samples specially processed to remove some or all of the Si substrates and CdTe buffer layers. Finally, the development of a broadband infrared/mm wave reflective coating will be undertaken.

28,Quasi-Resonant Absorption for Quantum Efficiency Improvement in Detectors,"Quasi-resonant absorption has been demonstrated to enhance the quantum efficiency of devices across the spectrum, but specifically it is a challenge in the UV portion of the spectrum. FDTD simulation will be employed to discover beneficial morphologies that can be fabricated with existing technologies at GSFC. This project could yield high impact results in relatively short time and low investment and if successful can be integrated realistically into future missions requiring optical devices or detectors across the spectrum (UV to far IR) as well. The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the increased quantum efficiency of detectors for different materials determined by the Astrophysics missions. Typical quantum efficiency  in the UV portion of the spectrum stands at 20-50%. This research is supported by a two-year research conducted by NSTRF fellow Eliad Peretz and Prof Tobias Hanrath from Cornell University (TRL 3-4). Specifically, this has been demonstrated with Silicon, and Silicon-on Insulator (SOI) wafers in lab conditions for wavelengths between 230-1300 nm and from 380-1600 nm at GSFC but will be applied to other materials and wavelengths.

29,Quantum Networking and Sensing using a Diamond Nanophotonic Circuit,"Quantum mechanics offers new ways to compute, communicate, and measure that are inherently more powerful than classical physics would allow. Of particular interest is the notion of a quantum network, where stationary and flying quantum bits (qubits) are transferred between remote nodes. Two strange quantum mechanical phenomena superposition and entanglement  allow such a quantum network to be used for feats impossible in a classical network. For example, a network of satellites with entangled qubit nodes would allow for perfectly secure communications, as well as more powerful distributed computing. Connecting a rover to the network would allow it to perform an ultraprecise quantum mechanical measurement by entangling one or more probe qubits to a sample, and then teleporting these qubits through the network for processing. The first links of such quantum networks have been demonstrated using Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. These NV centers are atomic defects in the diamond crystal that are both highly stable on a quantum mechanical level and easy to interact with optically, making them ideal for use in a network of qubits. The advantage of using this system over other candidates like cold atoms or trapped ions is that it can be operated over a wide range of temperatures and in a variety of atmospheric conditions, giving it great potential for use in space-based devices. However, current quantum networking schemes using NVs are limited by photon losses, restricting the efficiency - and thus scalability - of these systems. My research seeks to overcome this obstacle and develop a many-NV quantum node integrated onto a photonic circuit chip. To do so, I will integrate NV centers with optical nanocavities; through an effect called Purcell enhancement, these structures should increase the rate at which individual NVs emit photons that are coherent, that is, photons that maintain their quantum properties. Increasing the number of coherent photons emitted by an NV will increase the rate at which it can be entangled with other NVs and thus used for quantum networking. I will also need to improve the efficiency with this increased emission can be collected from the NVs. Doing so will require incorporating novel structures like optical waveguides and tapers in with the diamond cavity. These techniques will allow me to efficiently route and collect the photons emitted from single NVs and use them for entanglement with other NV centers. Once I have accomplished this, the last stage will be to place everything on a single chip. Integrating photonic circuits onto this chip will connect these many qubits and form a sort of quantum processor that can serve as a sensing device or a node in a quantum network. The properties of quantum mechanics would allow this node to communicate securely with other network points, or to perform distributed computations along with other devices in the same network. Quantum technologies for precision measurements already form the basis for the world's most accurate clocks and sensors, and a tailoring of this quantum node into a self-contained processor would allow for the creation of a light-weight quantum metrology device. For example, incorporating these chips into satellites would enable precision time-keeping in turn improving position, navigation, and timing for terrestrial and space applications. These new abilities will extend mankind's ability to learn and explore, both at the level of fundamental physics and on the scale of probing planets, moons, comets, and ultimately deeper space.

30,Robust and deterministic source of photon number states,"Quantum Sensors have use in a wide variety of applications including microscopy, positioning systems, communication technology, electric and magnetic field sensors, as well as geophysical areas. Significant gains from Quantum Sensors include technologies important for a range of NASA missions including efficient photon detection, optical clocks, gravimetry, gravitational wave sensing, ranging, and optical interferometry. Entangled multi-particle states used for precision measurements provide tools to reach the so-called Heisenberg limit and thus, overcome the shot-noise limit (fundamental noise limit for classical systems) and hence perform measurements at a precision unachievable for classical sensors. Quantum photon-number states, also known as Fock states, are the key ingredient to realizing the most useful entangled multi-particle states. Furthermore, photon-number states have applications in quantum communication and quantum information sciences as well. Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) will develop a robust and deterministic source of photon-number states. The source is based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion inside a low-loss optical loop – a switchable quantum ‘buffer’ – and will produce quantum photon-number states on demand at the telecommunications wavelength, thus providing a key resource for advanced quantum sensors.

31,Quantum-limited Amplifiers for Large Array Readout of Superconducting Detectors,"We propose to develop broadband, quantum-limited amplifiers based on parametric amplification to enhance the readout of highly multiplexed arrays of Transition Edge Sensor (TES) detectors and Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs).  A substantial fraction of NASA's portfolio consists of challenging photon-detection applications across the electromagnetic spectrum, for which arrays of cryogenic sensors of either TES or MKIDs are a key enabling technology. However for many important applications, the sensor array is limited by the noise temperature of the follow-on amplifier.  In the proposed research effort, we aim to reduce the noise of the follow-on amplifier by a factor of 10-20 relative to the current state-of-the-art, while maintaining the large bandwidth needed for the readout of highly multiplexed arrays.  By doing so, we will enhance the capability and increase the scalability of existing low temperature detector technologies in a cost-effective way.    Specifically, we will realize novel implementations of kinetic inductance traveling-wave (KIT) parametric amplifiers that explore artificial transmissions, discrete resonator phase matching, microstrip geometries, and 3-wave mixing.  In addition, we will develop Josephson junction traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (JTWPAs).  For most of these ideas, we have already published encouraging proof-of-principle demonstrations.  Our overarching goal is to create an amplifier with noise near the standard quantum limit, greater than 1 GHz bandwidth, greater than 15dB gain, and high saturation power well-suited to the needs of large array detector readout.  We will than implement our best performing amplifier in detector readout demonstrations of both TES and MKID arrays with 100s to 1000s of sensors.    We focus our efforts on applications in the mm/submm/FIR part of the spectrum.  Nevertheless, the proposed quantum-limited amplifiers have application from mm-waves to x-rays.  The proposed research effort will enable a broad range of NASA flagship mission concepts including OST, LUVOIR, and Lynx and is also directly applicable to recent probe-class studies the Probe of Inflation and Cosmic Origins (PICO) and the Galaxy Evolution Probe (GEP).

(Maxion) proposes to develop and field test a Carbon Monoxide (CO)-sensor prototype for post fire cleanup and CO detection. The sensor will have the dynamic range required to detect and monitor CO from approximately 1 to 500 ppmv with a resolution to 1 ppmv. Maxion will grow, fabricate and test a Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL) at a unique single-mode wavelength ideal for CO detection. Maxion will team with Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) to integrate the QCL into PSI's Wavelength Modulation Spectroscopy (WMS) platform. The WMS sensor board, previously developed for near-IR lasers, will be redesigned to accommodate QCL lasers. The QCL will be specially designed and fabricated for minimum power consumption. In Phase 1 the QCL was incorporated into the WMS platform and tested on a breadboard level. The breadboard sensor demonstrated the necessary dynamic range and easily surpassed the required minimum sensitivity. A Phase II prototype design was made based on the Phase I results for which dynamic range, sensitivity, SWaP, and operation with a high degree of reliability, minimal maintenance, and self-calibration under varying humidity and ambient pressures are primary design features. The sensor prototype will be tested in a relevant environment with controlled burns at a NASA test facility. Upon successful completion of all field tests, the TRL will be 6 at the end of Phase II.

33,Ultra-narrow Linewidth Lasers for Deployed Quantum Timing Applications,"Vescent Photonics, LLC in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory proposes to develop a compact, chip-scale ultra-narrow linewidth laser for next-generation fieldable quantum sensor applications including optical atomic clocks, two-way time transfer, and precision inertial force and gravity sensing. Atomic clocks represent the most precise and accurate instruments developed by scientists to date, offering measurement instabilities below 1x10-16 in a second. This level of accuracy enables the application of optical atomic clocks to a whole host of precision sensors, including the measurement of weak gravitational fields in near-zero gravity as well as accurate positioning, navigation, and timing onboard a spacecraft. However, high performance optical atomic clocks currently only exist in laboratory settings due to requirements of an ultra-narrow-linewidth (< 10 Hz) interrogation laser used as an optical flywheel for the atomic clock transition. The solution presented here for the development of an ultra-narrow linewidth laser is an extension to the initial investigations of Dr. William Loh at MIT-LL with chip-scale stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) cavities. Recent measurements conducted by the MIT-LL team have shown that chip-based photonic waveguide cavities can support ultranarrow-linewidth lasers; this effort seeks to increase the integration of necessary chip-scale components to move towards a design where the entire laser system is contained on a chip-scale device. This effort will focus on a design for chip-based SBS laser cavity with integrated frequency doubling for direct laser light generation at 674 nm for a 88Sr+ optical atomic clock. Packaging will also be designed to integrate easily with the near-infrared pump laser at 1348 nm.

34,Quantum Dot-based Miniaturized Multispectral Imager for Auroral Studies,"We propose to design, develop and demonstrate an ultra-compact, low mass, high resolution multispectral imager based on an innovative concept of Quantum Dot Array (QDA). QDA acts as an absorptive filter array and replaces prisms and gratings that require long path length to achieve high spectral resolution. We will design this first prototype to image the Auroral emissions at the visible wavelengths. However, we can extend the capability to ultraviolet wavelengths relatively easily to image the Sun in the near future. The proposed instrument technology development effort addresses NASA's Heliophysics Science Strategic Objective: ""to understand the Sun and its interactions with Earth and the solar system, including space weather"", and the Science Goal: ""Explore the physical processes in the space environment from the Sun to the Earth and throughout the solar system"". Quantum Dots (QD) are semiconductor nanocrystals with a size smaller than twice its exciton Bohr radius, leading to quantum confinement of electric charges, and a unique absorbance spectrum. As the size of QD decreases, the confinement strengthens, increasing the bandgap, and shifting the absorbance spectrum in wavelength. This size dependent bandgap, and thus absorbance, makes it possible to produce a well-defined, continuously tunable, yet distinct, set of absorptive filters, where each pixel is made of QDs of a specific size, shape or composition. Such a filter array can be integrated to a detector array to make a compact imaging instrument. Reducing path length is an advantage also provided by wedged filters; however, QDAs are much cheaper and provides the additional benefit of customizing the wavelength and bandwidth of only the spectral features of interest in order to maximize the signal to noise performance. The sample spectrum can be mathematically reconstructed using the characteristic response of each of the filters and measurements made by the instrument based on wavelength multiplexing principle. The compactness and low resource nature of this potentially revolutionary technique makes it a suitable instrument for small satellite missions such as CubeSats. In this effort, we will leverage our existing collaboration with Professor Bawendi at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of the pioneers of quantum dots. We will design and develop the spectrometer to image the key lines of Auroral emissions, including 486.1 nm (proton line), 557.7 nm (brightest Auroral line caused by O(1S)) and 630 nm (O(1D)) with 1 nm target resolution. We will synthesize the quantum dots of the selective size and composition for the target wavelength range; print them on a quartz substrate to fabricate the spectrometer; integrate the spectrometer with a commercial detector array; calibrate each of the pixels to produce their response curves; develop a mathematical algorithm to reconstruct target spectra; and perform night sky measurement of air glow emissions (558 nm is the brightest line) to complete an end-to-end demonstration of the prototype.

35,Quantum-Limited Amplifiers for Detector Arrays on NASA's Inflation Probe,"Recently, a NASA satellite mission, the Inflation Probe, has been proposed to search for B-mode polarization in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) the ""smoking gun"" for the theory of cosmic inflation and a window into physics at much higher energies than that possible in accelerator experiments. The two leading detector technologies for the Inflation Probe are the transition edge sensor (TES) and the microwave kinetic inductance detector (MKID). However, neither technology currently satisfies both the multiplexing and sensitivity requirements needed for the mission. I propose to resolve this issue by performing detector readout with the Dispersion-Engineered Traveling-Wave Kinetic Inductance (DTWKI) amplifier. To achieve this goal, the DTWKI must achieve greater than 20 dB gain over a fractional bandwidth of 30% on each side of the pump, large dynamic range, and near quantum-limited noise performance. However, the DTWKI is yet to realize these benchmarks. I propose a multi-pronged development program, based on experimental characterization of the DTWKI s component nitride thin films, optimization of transmission-line geometries, and new thermal-management techniques. The proposed work will involve extensive collaboration with NASA s JPL and the University of Pennsylvania. If successful, the DTWKI will have a revolutionary impact on observational astrophysics, enabling unprecedented sensitivity not only in the Inflation Probe, but also in NASA's far-infrared and X-ray astronomy missions.

36,Computer Optimization and 3D Printing of Quantum Dot Solar Cells,"The ability to assemble materials on the micro-to-nanometer scale continues to be an area of great scientific and technological interest. In the field of solar cells, using highly ordered arrays of nanoscale pillars as electrodes resulted in up to a 50% increase in solar cell efficiency compared to a flat electrode. Despite this success, it is challenging to predict from basic scientific principles which structures will improve photovolatic efficiency. Furthermore, current strategies for achieving structural control, such as self-assembly or etching, are extremely limited in the scope of structures that can be formed. My proposal explores exciting opportunities at the confluence of computer optimization and 3D printing to maximize efficiency of solar cells.  My proposed research will first apply this dual approach to the field of Quantum Dot (QD) assemblies for photovoltaics. Quantum dots hold tremendous potential for efficient solar energy conversion, which has broad impacts for our transition towards a sustainable energy portfolio. Despite impressive recent progress, one of the largest challenges in thin film QD solar cells is the poor extraction of photo-generated charges due to lack of continuous charge collection pathways. Therefore, even if exciton generation in QDs is record breaking, until there is sufficient control over QD assemblies that allows for collection of electrons at one of the electrodes, QD photovoltaic devices will not reach their full potential. The problem of inefficient charge collection is not specific to QD solar cells, and this research will enable more efficient overall solar cell design.  I initiated this research project because I saw the potential for computer optimization methods and 3D printing to vastly improve QD assemblies and their resultant photovoltaic performance. I sought out experts in these two very different fields and brought them together to collaborate on and solve this interdisciplinary problem. Both at Cornell University, Professor Hod Lipson in the Mechanical Engineering dept. is an expert in computational optimization and 3D printing, and Professor Tobias Hanrath in the Chemical Engineering dept. is an expert in QD assemblies. I will conduct my research jointly between their labs. I will use computational techniques to obtain optimized 3D structures for both the solar cell electrodes and for the QD assemblies. The best structures will be 3D printed and tested to verify the optimization methods. In the end, the optimization of structure by a combination of computer optimization and 3D printing will be broadly applicable to many technologies.

37,Many-Qubit Arrays for Analog and Digital-Analog Quantum Simulation,"In recent years, superconducting qubit technology has advanced to the point that it is becoming useful for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) applications. Of this, much interest has been directed towards the utility of this platform for analog bosonic and hybrid digital-analog simulation for application-specific Hamiltonians. Superconducting qubit designs for quantum simulation offer advantages over other modalities, such as ion traps and neutral atoms, due to the ease of individual control and the broad tunability of qubit frequencies and couplings [1]. Superconducting circuit-based quantum simulation is also particularly advantageous for open quantum systems as it can be engineered to simulate coupling to a particular environment [2].   Advances in 3D integration of low-loss superconducting circuits compatible with high quality qubits has enabled development of increasingly large 2D transmon arrays [3]. The native coupling of these qubits is extremely well-suited to simulating the Bose-Hubbard model, permitting the study of a large range of mesoscale condensed matter physics. Even small-scale simulations of these systems, on the order of a currently fabricable 6x6 qubit grid, exceed the capabilities of classical computation. Further, these qubit arrays can be used to create multi-photon entangled states when strongly coupled to 1D superconducting waveguides [4]. This entanglement can then be distributed to multiple qubits using artificial giant atoms that allow the qubit-waveguide coupling to be tuned dynamically [5]. The coherent preparation of many-body entangled states in this way may permit simulation of non-local interactions as well as fermionic coupling to bosonic continua.

38,"InN-Based Quantum Dot Solar Cells, Phase II","The goal of this STTR program is to employ nanostructured materials in an advanced device design to enhance the tolerance of solar cells to extreme environments while maintaining high solar electric power conversion efficiency.  By using InN-based quantum dots embedded within a higher band gap GaN barrier material, a larger fraction of the solar spectrum can be harnessed while minimizing the effects of high temperatures and high-energy radiation with this promising photovoltaic device.  The wide range of energies accessible to InN-based materials provides unique flexibility in designing quantum dot solar cell structures.  Phase I work demonstrated the feasibility of synthesizing device quality InN-based quantum dots.  InN quantum dot assemblies were grown on GaN templates via metalorganic chemical vapor deposition and exhibited well defined x-ray diffraction peaks with dot densities up to 1E10 cm-2.  More importantly, strong room temperature photoluminescence has been observed, with peak emission energies ranging from the infrared to the ultraviolet.  These promising optical properties suggest it will be possible to build structures incorporating InN quantum dots within a GaN p-n junction to test the basic concepts of quantum dot solar cells during the Phase II effort.  The principal Phase II objective is to develop an InN-based quantum dot solar cell capable of high performance in near-sun and extreme radiation environments.  Ultimately our approach provides a pathway for realizing solar cells with over 2,000 W/kg of specific power and power conversion efficiency approaching 60%.

39,Room-Temperature Single-Photon Source for Secure Quantum Communication,"We are asking for four years of support for PhD student Justin Winkler's work on a research project entitled ""Room temperature single photon source for secure quantum communication"". This project will be carried out at the Institute of Optics of the University of Rochester, one of the world's best schools in quantum optics. To prepare for this project, J. Winkler has taken several advanced quantum optics courses at this University, including a quantum optics and quantum information laboratory course. J. Winkler is planning to work in the laboratory of Dr. Lukishova, who will be his PhD thesis advisor (http://www.optics.rochester.edu/users/lukishov/single-photon-source.shtml). This proposal is for the creation of a room temperature single photon source device with photons exhibiting antibunching (all photons are separated in time). Such a device is a pivotal element in a quantum communication system. Quantum cryptography allows for the absolutely secure distribution of cryptographic keys between two parties, ensuring the security of encrypted communication. The practical realization of quantum cryptographic schemes has been held back in part due to the difficulty in the creation of a robust source capable of producing antibunched photons on demand and at room temperature. In many quantum cryptography systems currently used, highly attenuated laser sources are used instead of single photon sources. Attenuated laser light is contaminated with bunches of multiple photons, and is therefore not secure against photon number splitting attacks. Antibunched photons are created by focusing a laser beam to excite a single photon emitter. A single emitter will emit one photon at a time due to its finite fluorescence lifetime. To create such a device, it is necessary to study and evaluate a variety of single photon emitters in different hosts, including colloidal quantum dots, color centers in nanodiamonds, and rare-earth doped nanocrystals. We will also study how to enhance the fluorescence of these single emitters using microcavities, photonic crystals, and metamaterials as hosts. The geometry of microcavities will be used to give the emitted photons a definite polarization, which is necessary to increase the efficiency of quantum cryptography systems. This project's long term goal is the creation of a compact and efficient room-temperature single photon source device. Study of these materials will be accomplished using confocal fluorescence microscopy along with a Hanbury Brown and Twiss setup. J. Winkler has already begun research on this project, where he has observed antibunched photons emitted from single colloidal quantum dots in a chiral liquid crystal photonic bandgap microcavity. J. Winkler has also carried out spectral measurements of single colloidal quantum dots in these microcavities. This research is of unique interest to NASA because of the potential of extending quantum communication to a space environment and allowing for absolutely secure communication on the global scale. A relevant project on quantum communication in space is being performed by Zeilinger's group at the University of Vienna, Austria, and is supported by the European Space Agency. Researchers from this group have sent photons to an orbiting satellite and subsequently observed photons that are reflected from the satellite in a manner meant to mimic a single photon source. This experiment serves to demonstrate the feasibility of establishing a single photon quantum link between Earth and Space.  We believe that this research is of interest of Dr. Sean Spillane, the NASA Ames Quantum Laboratory Experimental Lead (http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/research/qpl/spillane-index.html). Quantum communications technology area is included in NASA Communication and Navigation Systems Roadmap, November 2010, page TAO5-21.

40,Quantum Computing to Accelerate High Fidelity Computational Materials Modeling,"The future of quantum computing will require the development of both hardware and software to realize impactful research in scientific disciplines. There is currently a critical need to create the algorithms that will efficiently run physics and chemistry problems on quantum computing hardware. Quantum simulations are expected to be a domain where quantum computers will be highly impactful. Quantum computers have thus far been used to simulate small molecules but have yet to be applied to material science applications. Materials are different than molecules in several important ways and require their own efficient and practical quantum computing algorithms to be developed. It is our goal to develop the technology for such simulations. Dramatic speed-ups and increases in simulation capabilities are expected in material science simulations using quantum computers. Mainstream classical simulations in material science have limitations in the fidelity of results that can be produced with reasonable computing power. There is a range of methods that are currently used for classical simulations which includes density functional theory and quantum Monte Carlo, among others. Many of these approaches are adapted to run efficiently on modern computing architectures such as GPUs and large supercomputing platforms. However, for many applications such as excited states, defect modeling, surface catalysis, or generally materials with difficult to simulate strong electron-correlations, we are continually interested in improving our simulation approaches. For many material applications, it is evident that more accurate computations are required to simulate experimental conditions. While quantum computers are poised to make an impact in the field of materials simulation, state of the art quantum algorithms designed to run on quantum computers have so far been restricted to small molecules. Extending these calculations to more difficult systems in the realm of material science or otherwise has not been developed.

41,Entangled Photon Pair Source Based On Thin-Film Lithium-Niobate-On-Insulator Photonic Integrated Circuits,"Herein, PSI propose a system-on-chip (SoC) solution for an entangled photon pair source (EPPS) based on thin-film lithium niobate on insulator (TFLNOI) photonic integrated circuits (PIC). Using integrated photonic devices such as fiber coupler, waveguide, modulator, splitter/combiner and micro-ring, the proposed EPPS can generate and process the entangled photons with high efficiency and speed. In phase I effort, we developed theoretical models to study the spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) conversion efficiencies based on both hybrid and ridge waveguide LNOI PIC designs. We have successfully demonstrated an in-situ monitored periodically poling process with small poling periods and large poling gaps. Leveraging other on-going PSI projects, we have also fabricated and characterized the key PIC components for the proposed EPPS chip, including low-loss waveguides, fiber coupler, high extinction splitter/combiner, micro-ring resonator and high-speed modulator. The phase I result paved a solid foundation toward a high-efficiency EPPS PIC chip. In phase II, we will continue the PIC components development focusing on the ridge waveguide designs, and experimentally demonstrate all the key PIC components. We will further refine the periodically poled LNOI (PPLNOI) process with improved accuracy and automation. Through the collaboration with RIT, our subcontractor, who has significant experiences in quantum photonic system testing and characterization, we will demonstrate the entanglement of the SPDC generated photon pair. Lastly, we will perform initial integration and packaging for the EPPS chip based on advanced photonic wire-bonding technology. Based on our pioneer work in TFLNOI PICs development and with our successful experiences in commercialization of SBIR research efforts, PSI is poised to develop, package, qualify and commercialize the proposed EPPS chip for tomorrow’s quantum communication demands.

42,Narrow-Spectrum Two-Photon Sources for Space-Based Quantum Communication,"Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon that can be harnessed to increase the sensitivity of sensors, create unbreakable communication security, and enable powerful new computers. Space-based applications, however, require entangled photon sources that must operate in the presence of abundant sunlight. Because quantum techniques require the measurement of single photons, background light poses a formidable challenge. One of the major constraints limiting the effectiveness of filtering techniques is the large spectral bandwidth of the entangled photon sources themselves (~1-2nm). To address this problem, Qubitekk proposed to develop narrowband photon pair sources for space-based quantum communication. The Phase I effort revealed two approaches that are feasible with today’s technology and these two will form the basis of the Phase II effort. The first approach is to filter the output of a conventional single-pass downconversion source and to compensate for the reduced output by increasing the pump laser power. The second approach is based on cavity-enhanced downconversion, in which the nonlinear crystal is placed in an optical cavity that has the effect of enhancing emission at resonant wavelengths and suppressing emission elsewhere. Although this approach is more complex, much narrower bandwidths can be achieved, not only offering greater background discrimination but also a source capable of coupling to matter-based qubits. The latter feature is an important element of quantum repeater development. These two approaches will be achieved through the execution of four Technical Objectives: 1) Demonstrate filtered downconversion with strong pump; 2) Conduct studies of filtered downconversion with realistic lighting conditions; 3) Demonstrate cavity-enhanced downconversion; and 4)Demonstrate narrowband photon detection using an etalon filter.

43,Narrow-Spectrum Two-Photon Sources for Space-Based Quantum Communication,"Entangled photons exhibit the unique property of non-locality – meaning the behavior of one photon is “dependent” upon the behavior of another photon, even when the photons are separated by vast differences. Originally created through fragile laboratory experiments, quantum entangled photon sources have matured recently into commercial sources that are rugged and much easier to use. With the growing availability of these commercial sources, new applications have begun to emerge. One such application, quantum key distribution, is the use of quantum entangled photons to create a never-ending supply of unbreakable cryptographic keys for secure satellite-to-satellite communications (see figure at right).To date, commercial entangled photon sources have been used primarily for terrestrial, indoor applications - where unwanted ambient light can be easily controlled. Space-based applications, however, require sources that must operate in the presence of abundant sunlight.One of the major constraints limiting the effectiveness of filtering techniques is the large spectral bandwidth of the entangled photon sources themselves (~1-2nm). This broad spectral output limits the ability of spectral filters to isolate the quantum signal, since the filter must have a comparable bandwidth to avoid reducing the intensity of the source. By developing a source with a narrowed spectral output, much greater isolation of the quantum signal is possible. Toward this goal, we propose to design a bright entangled photon source with a spectral bandwidth 100x narrower (<10pm) than today’s commercial sources. Evaluating the performance of four different design approaches, we will down-select the design that achieves the greatest improvement. Finally, we will show that this improvement, when combined with existing spatial and temporal filters, can achieve the isolation of quantum photons from natural solar photons required to conduct quantum key distribution between satellites.

44,Quantum Sensor for D/H Ratio Measurement in Water in Outer Planets,"Compact chip-scale nano-NMR sensors to measure D/H ratio in water of outer planets based on atomistic defects in semiconductors will have orders of magnitude improved sensitivity compared to classical NMR instruments. Our sensors will be able to detect D/H ratio in reduced sample size as the magnetic fields generated by small samples are too small for traditional sensors to detect. Microscopic modeling of noise and nuclear dipole fields will estimate spin and charge noise frequency-dependent spectra of the D/H ratio sensor with a given set of parameters including geometry, dimensions, surface termination composition, and temperature. Our computer-assisted design (CAD) software will be used in the optimization of the sensor for D/H ratio measurements of water by identifying configurations/designs and microwave (MW) interrogation protocols where the NMR signals from hydrogen and deuterium can be reliably measured from the underlying base noise and thus maximizing the sensitivity. We will design the optimal sensitivity of the sensor based on tradeoffs for isotopic purity, regularity of thickness of substrate material and defect occurrence. A Phase II plan will be constructed, identifying the issues related to device growth and fabrication, testing, and integration. Plans will be developed to mitigate issues and partners confirmed for the Phase II project.

45,Computational Studies of Inelastic Scattering using Mixed Quantum/Classical Theory,"Molecules are an important component of the universe that dominates the cooling process and determines the degree of ionization of interstellar gas clouds and, hence, regulates star and planet formation. The exploration of paths toward chemical complexity in space has direct bearing on the origin and evolution of life. Moreover, molecular transitions provide a sensitive probe of the dynamics and the physical and chemical conditions in a wide range of objects at scales ranging from newly forming planetary systems to galactic and extragalactic sizes.  In the vast majority of the conditions present in the interstellar/circumstellar/cometary media, the so-called collisional de-excitation rate coefficients are indispensable to convert an observed signal into a species column density and, therefore, abundance, and to constrain the density and temperature of the emitting or absorbing gas. However, a significant part of this information is still missing and there is no simple way of determining it from the laboratory experiments.  In order to fill this serious gap, we will approach the problem by employing a mixture of quantum and classical mechanics in a state-of-the-art theoretical approach to the dynamics of molecule + quencher collision. We showed that it is feasible to simplify the physical model and gain a significant computational advantage by treating selected degrees of freedom classically, while the most important internal degrees of freedom are still treated quantum mechanically. In this project we propose to carry out:  i) Benchmark MQCT calculations of rotational quenching of H2O (including deuterated forms) by H2 at lower temperatures first, to compare against the existing full-quantum scattering calculations, but then at higher temperatures where no accurate data exists, up to , typical to hot cores and corinos, outflow shocks, and the innermost regions of protoplanetary discs.  ii) Conceptually new calculations of ro-vibrational quenching and excitation of the most astronomically relevant excited bending mode of H2O, first by atomic quencher, He, and then by molecular quencher, H2, using MQCT, in a broad range of temperatures, up to  when these processes become important (typical to red supergiant stars).  iii) First detailed calculations for H2O + H2O rotational quenching and excitation within MQCT framework in the temperature range  relevant to warm star-forming regions or cometary environment. Deuterated forms of ortho/para-water can all be studied.

46,Nano-Optic Probing of Vibrational Modes of Defects and Color Centers in Semiconductors,"Defect-based single-photon emitters (SPEs) have a significant advantage in quantum sensing and quantum communications because of their robustness to non-ideal environments and atomic-size footprint. This proposal investigates the origins of point defects in wide bandgap semiconductors as well as their interactions with the host crystal. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy is the standard technique for characterizing SPEs but may not capture local lattice effects like strain or vibrational modes that can influence the emission. This proposal uses infrared nano-optic probes to characterize the local vibrational properties that arise from defect SPEs, and spatially correlate with their PL spectral signatures. Scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) and nanoscale Fourier transform infrared (nano-FTIR) spectroscopy—with full spectral coverage between 5-15 μm and < 20 nm spatial resolution—can examine the behavior of materials beyond their bulk properties and provide vital information for the development of quantum devices. Exciting SPEs with either an ultraviolet (390 nm) or near-infrared (1560 nm) ultrafast pump laser creates a non- equilibrium environment that can be probed with ultrafast nano-FTIR (< 200 fs) and reveal local lattice dynamics and interactions. The outcome of this work will create an efficient, non-destructive method for identifying defect SPEs and uncover information about the local influence of lattice vibrations, which have been theorized as a possible means of deterministic entanglement, an essential component for quantum technologies.

47,"Quantum Dot Spectrum Converters for Enhanced High Efficiency Photovoltaics, Phase I","This research proposes to enhance solar cell efficiency, radiation resistance and affordability. The Quantum Dot Spectrum Converter (QDSC) disperses quantum dots into the transparent silicone layer that normally functions as coverglass adhesive. The Quantum Dots (QD) act as a fluorescent spectrum converter for solar cells, to allow the use of the 20-50% of the solar spectrum unavailable to today's highest efficiency solar cells. By selecting QD's of particular compositions and sizes, we customize absorption and emission spectra to down-convert UV photons, including multiple exciton generation, and up-convert IR photons in a multiple photon process. This approach overcomes the fundamental 'red-loss' and 'blue-loss' limitations, allowing more efficiency from conventional single- and multi-bandgap photovoltaic devices. We also explore the use of a QDSC in a non-tracking fluorescent concentrator for enhancing flux and shielding for solar cells and in thermophotovoltaic systems as a means of enhancing efficiency while eliminating selective emitters. These approaches address the topic need for significantly improved efficiency and radiation hardening for deep space missions ? the QDSC can significantly enhance conversion efficiency of qualified, high-efficiency cells, while its implementation in a luminescent or thermophotovoltaic concentrator allows solar cells to be shielded from adverse radiation and thermal environments.

48,"Quantum Fingerprint-Based Air Quality Monitoring in Coastal Environments, Phase I","Coastal environments vital to our nation are strongly impacted by natural and human factors and are also sensitive to global climate change.  A need exists for innovative new field measurement technologies to support NASA's remote sensing efforts in coastal regions.  Two specific subjects of interest include the air quality in coastal regions and algal blooms.  We proposed to develop for commercialization a Quantum FingerprintTM sensor based on a sapphire substrate that can be used for both even though they are not closely related.  For air quality measurement in the coastal environment we will use the flexible QFTM technology to simultaneously detect, discriminate, and quantify levels of SOx and NOx.  This flexibility, which arises from the unique set of energy levels created by the interaction of each species with the sensor, will also allow the same sensor to detect and monitor algal blooms by keying on their characteristic gaseous emissions.  Thus, arrays of QFTM sensors, both on and off shore, could simultaneously monitor coastal air quality and track algal blooms.  Our goal is to assess how well two relatively different applications might be served by a single type of QFTM sensor when they occur in the same geographic area.

49,Plasma based growth of diamond semiconductor in microgravity with controlled color centers for quantum applications,"The overall goal of this project is to successfully prepare diamond films with controlled color centers in microgravity, suitable for various terrestrial quantum technologies being pursued for extensive commercial applications in quantum sensing, quantum cryptography, quantum computing and quantum information processing. The major technical issues currently include realization of distinguishable emission, improving photon collection efficiency and other practical issues, all related to material quality, control of color centers (their location and distribution) and manufacturing technologies. There is an opportunity to address the above issues and develop a clear understanding of controlling mechanisms in the growth and incorporation of color centers through microgravity experiments that can eventually lead to manufacturing facilities in space. We aim to conduct microgravity experimental studies in four years from the start of Phase I. An existing plasma based printer, originally developed as an alternative to inkjet and aerosol jet printing and successfully commercialized, will be adapted into a plasma reactor in the proposed project. Availability of this hardware significantly reduces the risk in the proposed effort. The Phase I effort will demonstrate the capability of growing diamond using the plasma printer operated in a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition mode and methane-hydrogen precursors. Diamond films will also be printed using diamond nanopowder ink. Silicon color centers will be incorporated onto the diamond films from both cases above simply by injecting silicon ink into the plasma printer. In addition to these preliminary demonstrations, the Phase I effort will prepare a clear plan for the microgravity preparation of diamond films with controlled color centers, assess modifications necessary for the plasma printer for microgravity operation, and conduct design and process development studies for successful microgravity experiments.

50,"Flexible, Lightweight Quantum Dot Solar Cells Using Plasmonic-Enhanced Light Absorption","Solar cells, or photovoltaic cells, are critical to NASA operations due to the abundance and availability of solar power. Current photovoltaic technology is based on bulk semiconductor wafers, which are typically non-conformal. In contrast, flexible, lightweight solar cells can be incorporated on to the surfaces of rovers and habitats. This can be used to generate auxiliary power that can power additional sensors or extend the battery life during space exploration. This research proposes the fabrication of solar cells that are conformal and inexpensive, and can be adhered to a variety of surfaces that were previously unsuitable for photovoltaic technology. The objective of this research proposal is to fabricate the first flexible, efficient, quantum dot solar cell. The nanoscopic quantum dots are critical to this device because of their enhanced optical properties and solution-processability. Solution-processability reduces the required material because thin semiconductor quantum dot films can be deposited using low cost methods, such as inkjet printing. Not only does this reduce the weight and cost of the device, but it also enables the use of flexible and conformal substrates. Thus, solution-processable quantum dots can improve the optical efficiency, reduce the weight and cost, and enable flexible and conformal devices. As a trade-off, additional plasmonic-enhanced light absorption techniques will be required to achieve high power conversion efficiencies. This plasmonic-ehanced light absorption requires metal nanoparticles to scatter and concentrate light in the solar cell. Using nano-scale structures can improve solar cell power conversion efficiency in a lightweight, flexible device. To achieve the optimal design configuration, the quantum dot films must be fabricated and characterized. Once the quantum dot film can be quantified in electrical and optical terms, the device performance can be modeled. In particular, modeling of optical behavior is performed by finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation software, whereas electronic behavior is modeled using a solar cell simulation tool, PC1D. Since many of the device parameters are inter-related to the device performance, both electronic and optical simulation results must be used to optimize all of the device parameters. After optimization, an efficient, flexible, lightweight quantum dot solar cell can be fabricated. In addition to improving photovoltaic technology, research in this field can advance the understanding of nano-scale device design. These quantum dots contain approximately 100 to 100,000 atoms and behave very differently from their macroscopic counterparts. Since many of the properties observed at this nanoscopic scale are governed by the principles of quantum mechanics, on-going research must relate nano-scale phenomena to macroscopic behavior. Both experimental and simulation techniques are used in this research proposal to relate theory of nano-scale phenomena into a real-world, functional device.

51,"Ultra-Compact, Field-Deployable, Quantum-Compatible Receiver for Free-Space Optical Communication","Quantum Opus is excited to propose compactifying, enclosing, and automating ALL of the required vacuum, cryogenics, and electrical systems of a superconducting nanowire single-photon detection system into a 14-inch tall by 17-inch wide by 18-inch deep package and re-engineering the optical collection mechanisms to be compatible with existing NASA telescope infrastructure. The end product will be a multi-optical-channel, rack-mountable system roughly the size of an oscilloscope which can, at the push of a button, or remote command, go from a completely dormant to active state. This would include: pumping out its own vacuum can, activating the integrated helium compressor at appropriate vacuum pressure, and biasing the nanowire detectors at desired base temperature, while enabling continuous counting for near-infrared photons at rates approaching 1 GHz on each optical channel. Wall plug power draw will be ≤500 W and down time for maintenance will only be required every 50,000 hours of run time. The system will host two types of detector payloads, single-mode fiber coupled detectors for integration into terrestrial fiber-optic quantum communications networks and detectors coupled to 50-micron core graded-index multimode fibers for connection to telescopes for either classical or quantum free-space communication. Dark count rates are expected to be between 1 and 10 dark counts Hz per 1550-nm mode for a net dark rate of 1 to 10 kHz for the multimode coupled devices. This will be a transformational technology enabling global-scale deployment of receiver stations for a space-integrated, hybrid classical/quantum, optical communications network for high-rate optical data return from and unassailable secure command and control communications to space telescopes, asteroid mining craft, and other remotely controllable spacecraft.

53,"Stable, solar-blind ultraviolet III-nitride photocathode imagers with high quantum efficiency","Currently, many detectors used in ultraviolet (UV) instruments utilize a photocathode to convert UV photons into electrons that are subsequently detected by microchannel plate or CCD. UV photocathodes provide low dark count rate combined with high out-of-band rejection. The performance of these detectors critically depends on the efficiency and stability of their photocathodes. In particular, photocathode instability is responsible for many of the fabrication difficulties commonly experienced with this class of detectors. In this effort, we will advance to TRL-4 a new type of cesium-free photocathode using III-nitride materials (GaN, AlN, and their ternary alloy Al(1-x)Ga(x)N) to achieve highly efficient, solar blind, stable UV response.    In recent years, group-III/nitride (in particular GaN) photocathodes have been demonstrated with high quantum efficiency (QE) (>50%) in the UV spectral range. In particular, GaN photocathodes have promise to substantially surpass the QE of photocathodes fabricated from other materials. Moreover, due to the tunable wide bandgaps of III-nitride materials, photocathode response can be tailored, and can be made intrinsically solar-blind. However, these photocathodes still rely on reactive materials (such as cesium) for activation, necessitating in many cases all-vacuum fabrication and sealed-tube operation. In addition to the expense, mass, and fragility of the sealed-tube configuration, QE has been observed to degrade with cesiated photocathodes, even in the vacuum environment. The photocathode/microchannel plate structure proposed here achieves activation through methods for band structure engineering such as delta-doping and polarization field engineering. Compared to the current state-of-the-art microchannel plate sealed tubes, they will provide high QE and significantly enhance stability, fabrication yield, and reliability.    We have demonstrated III-nitride photocathode operation without the use of cesium. We have implemented III-nitride polarity control, polarization charge engineering, and alloy fraction control to demonstrate high-QE UV photocathodes. However, further work is needed to provide improved stability over time, even higher QE, and truly tunable response enabled by AlGaN heterostructures. These improvements will be achieved by employing novel designs, surface passivation methods, and heterostructure growth techniques, and by continued optimization of placement of internal fixed charge.     We will demonstrate the performance of these detectors in a system that includes either conventional micro-channel plate instruments (MCPs) or solid-state arrays with gain such as electron-bombarded CCD arrays. This technology will be enabling for future large UV spectroscopic and imaging missions such as HabEx and LUVOIR, as well as smaller orbital and sub-orbital missions where low mass, high QE, high out-of-band rejection, low dark count rates, and robustness are of primary importance.

54,"Ultra-Compact, Field-Deployable, Quantum-Compatible Receiver for Free-Space Optical Communication","NASA’s previous and planned free-space optical communications will leverage a pulse-position modulation encoding to maximize photon information efficiency in a heavily attenuated communications channel. Quantum Opus is already developing commercially scalable superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) systems capable of facilitating this type of communications link by providing unprecedented count rates, collection areas, and system detection efficiencies. Looking to the future, the data rate of these channels will likely be limited by the timing resolution of the detectors themselves. The current standard specification of Quantum Opus SNSPDs for telecom wavelengths is <100 ps, <50 ps with cryogenic amplifiers. However, recent works[1,2] have shown that the intrinsically limited timing jitter of NbN and MoSI SNSPDs is as low as 4.6 ps and 10.6 ps respectively by creating devices small enough that there is no so-called “geometric” jitter contribution caused by spatial distribution of the photons across the nanowire. Other recent work has shown two approaches to reduce the jitter of SNSPDs: reading out pulses from both ends[3] of the nanowire to minimize the geometric jitter contribution and integrating an impedance matching taper[4] into the device to reduce coupling losses to 50 ohm readout lines and increase signal to noise at the trigger threshold. We will pursue both of these paths and integrate them into our large-area, high-count-rate, multi-element SNSPD system. [1] B. Korzh et al., Nature Photonics 14, 250 (2020) [2] M.

55,Computational Modeling of Thermionic Energy Conversion for Nuclear Electric Propulsion,"With interplanetary human spaceflight missions on the horizon, technological advancements for efficiently transporting astronauts beyond our Earth-Moon system are a necessity. One propulsion design that could enable human missions to Mars is nuclear electric propulsion. This propulsion system includes a fission reactor, radiation shield, power conversion system, thermal management system, and high-powered electric propulsion thrusters for directing the trajectory of the spacecraft bus and payloads. A primary challenge with this design is simultaneously providing sufficient power to support the high-powered propulsion system while also achieving sufficient heat rejection to manage the thermal load produced by the reactor power subsystem. Utilizing dynamic power conversion such as with Brayton, Rankine, and Stirling cycle engines introduces a working fluid and additional mechanical components to the design which increases both the complexity of the subsystem and the number of potential failure points. This proposal intends to explore and develop thermionic power conversion technologies to eliminate the necessity of moving parts in the power conversion process by using thermionics to convert heat directly to energy. Thermionics are uniquely suited to nuclear electric propulsion due to their ability not only to serve as the energy conversion system but also provide a mode of heat rejection, reducing the radiator surface area required to support the high thermal loads from the nuclear power system. The intent is to create a model that combines the physical mechanisms that accelerate thermionic emission, such as ion-enhanced emission and quantum tunneling effects, with thermal transport and heat dissipation modes. The method for accomplishing this thermionic energy conversion technology development is separated into the following milestones. First, a comprehensive literature review will be completed. This literature review will be followed by an investigation of optimal thermionic emitter candidates for use in high-power systems. Then, a theoretical model will be developed to characterize the emitter current density, specific to the material properties and including enhanced emission effects. A study of the heat transport and conversion process for the emitter will follow the development of the theoretical model and will occur simultaneously to the investigation into thermionic energy conversion efficiency improvement methods. Finally, the development of the computational model is integral to the success of this project and will include the ion-enhanced emission and quantum tunneling effects of the thermionic emitter. To summarize, my research goals include the successful modeling of advanced emission methods including ion-enhanced emission and quantum tunneling techniques. I will investigate thermionic emitters most effective for high temperature, high emission current applications in nuclear electric space propulsion systems and develop both theoretical and computational models. Then, I will perform an optimization of the thermionic energy conversion system to balance the energy conversion efficiency with the heat rejection needed to offset the high thermal loads produced by the nuclear power source.

56,Next Generation Vector Vortex Waveplates for Astronomical Coronagraphs,"Vector vortex waveplates (VVWs) are highly promising technology enabling astronomical coronagraph masks for exoplanet imaging and characterization. Currently, the technology basics are well known, and there have been successful demonstrations of VVWs meeting several key operational requirements. The next generation of VVWs under development will make it possible to extend their spectral range of performance into infrared, further increase the contrast using novel materials, and would improve manufacturing to reduce cost. Yield and quality will be increased by eliminating internal and external sources of structural non-uniformities and defects and by employing novel minimally invasive manufacturing processes. Novel designs and device architectures to be developed in the Phase 2 of the project are intended to improve performance of VVWs to the levels that would not require polarization filtering thus increasing the throughput nearly twice. High contrast liquid crystal polymer broadband reflective VVWs to be developed wherein geometrical phase is insensitive to retardation would allow novel coronagraph architectures while minimizing dependence on process conditions and simplifying manufacturing. Furthermore, the next generation VVWs would allow reducing size and weight of coronagraphs by integrating VVW technology with other planar optics functions.

57,"High Efficiency Quantum Dot III-V Thermophotovoltaic Cell for Space Power, Phase II","For NASA deep space science missions, radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG) fueled by plutonium-238 are used to provide on-board source of heat, which is then converted to electricity. At present, NASA uses 8% efficient thermoelectric conversion systems.  Compound semiconductor thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cells provide an attractive alternative.  The highest efficiency TPV cell reported is a 23.6% (radiator at 1039?C, cell at 25?C) InGaAs monolithically interconnected module (MIM) on InP. We proposed an InGaAs TPV cell which incorporates InAs quantum dots to provide sub-gap absorption thus improving its short-circuit current.  This cell could then be integrated into a MIM to achieve a TPV cell whose efficiency would significantly exceed (by about 15% to 20%) the state-of-the-art.  In Phase I we demonstrated the feasibility of growing InAs quantum dots on 0.6 eV InGaAs on lattice-mismatched InP, and that these quantum dots, when inserted into the TPV cell, extend the bandedge, providing sub-bandgap absorption. In Phase II we propose to optimize the quantum dot structures to improve efficiency of the TPV cells, and integrate them into MIMs to achieve very high conversion efficiencies.  Resulting higher specific power and power density of the overall power systems will be of great benefit to NASA in the form of lower launch costs and increased mission capability.

58,Earth-to-Satellite Quantum Key Distribution with Noise Reduction via Entangled Photon Time Correlation,"The objective of this proposal is to establish a provably secure communication link between ground and low-earth-orbit (LEO). Current communication technologies rely on assumptions about the computational abilities of eavesdroppers (e.g., factoring prime numbers is computationally prohibitive). However, these assumptions have come into question because of recent developments in computational technology such as quantum computers. If such devices were developed and obtained by malicious eavesdroppers, all current communication, from bank transactions to classified government information, would be subject to attack. Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a provably secure method of communication (depending only on the laws of quantum mechanics) that would not be vulnerable to attacks from any amount of computational power. The goal of this project is to develop a QKD protocol that could be used between earth and LEO satellites, securing the integrity of manned and unmanned NASA missions and perhaps setting the stage for a revolution in global secure communication. QKD has been demonstrated in a variety of contexts, including through fiber and through free space. A recent study was able to perform QKD over 143 km of free space through far more atmospheric thickness than exists between the surface of the earth and LEO, proving in principle that such communication is possible. However, this feat was only accomplished on dark nights and at a bit rate of tens of bits per second at best. This example serves to highlight two practical challenges in free-space quantum communication. First, one must have a very high rate single-photon source in order to achieve suitably high data rates after unavoidable losses due to atmospheric effects. Second, one must be able to filter out all other photons received, such as those emanating from the sun. Without meeting these criteria, a practical ground-to-satellite QKD system will not be possible. I propose a modification to the BB84 QKD protocol that will allow for considerable noise cancellation and will function with a high-rate aperiodic entangled photon source such as one operating via spontaneous parametric down conversion. This modification, which I will refer to as BB84+, involves the sender detecting one photon from each entangled pair and classically sharing the time tag of this ""idler"" photon with the receiver, who in turn uses this information to determine which of the photons he has received did in fact come from the sender and which photons were actually noise. Combined with other measures such as wavelength optimization, such a protocol could be used to reduce noise to a manageable level while performing practical QKD from ground to LEO in daylight. Demonstrating such a system would be a significant step towards ensuring the security of future NASA missions as well as all personal and governmental communications.

59,"A Room-Temperature High-Speed Quantum Dot Infrared Photodetector with High Photodetectivity, Phase I","The STTR Phase I proposal aims to develop innovative device concepts and fabrication techniques that enable the construction of high-performance uncooled long-wave infrared (LWIR, 8-12?Ym) photodetectors. LWIR photodetectors are of great importance in real-time acquisition of radiation characteristics of the Earth and its environments for understanding and predicting the Earth's climate and potential hazards. Quantum dot infrared photodetector (QDIP) technology offers an excellent choice for LWIR sensing due to its superior performance, including high temporal resolution (<1 ?Ys) and low noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD <10mK). However, existing QDIP technology requires cryogenic cooling to reduce dark current, which substantially increases size, weight and power consumption. Because of this, the proposed research aims to develop innovative device concepts and fabrication techniques that can substantially reduce dark current, thus allow the construction of uncooled QDIPs. The uncooled QDIP technology enables high-performance LWIR detecting on a chip with significantly reduced payload. It is highly desired in many Earth science applications. The Phase I work will perform feasibility investigation of the proposed device concept, optimize quantum dots growth and annealing techniques and produce a preliminary design for a prototype system that can be built and demonstrated in Phase II with a NASA supplied platform.

60,Ink-jet printable infrared detectors for in-space deployment,"Solution-processed organic/inorganic materials show promise as sensing materials that are light-weight, inexpensive, and flexible while allowing simple fabrication techniques such as inkjet printing. The proposed research focuses on the development of solution-based materials and fabrications methods for infrared (IR) sensors applicable in a wide range of space missions, concentrating on crew health monitoring and remote sensing. We will develop a composite material system that enables efficient electrical carrier transfer and transport with a tailored IR spectral response. We will incorporate i) different quantum dots and structures for specific spectral sensitization and maximal light absorption; ii) enhance interparticle interaction through ligand engineering and surface passivation to improve inter-particle energy transfer; iii) extend IR sensitivity by investigating methods to improve nanocrystal stability (core-shell, ligands, and oxygen-free processing); and iv) combining broad-spectrum absorbing organic polymers to maximize charge transfer. These materials and device efforts are coupled with structural, chemical, optical (continuous wave and time-resolved) and electrical characterization. Novel device structures will be systematically evaluated to ascertain the nanostructures necessary to optimize detectivity, quantum efficiency for IR sensing and power conversion efficiency (PCE). This projects outcome will be a commercially comparable NIR detector, photocurrent >1.3 uA and max power > 324 nW, to function as a crew health monitoring platform, fabricable on demand in space using lightweight materials.

61,Dispersion Compensation of Mid-Infrared Frequency Comb Spectrometer for Planetary Science,"Mid-infrared spectrometers have been shown demonstrated to be very useful instruments aboard interplanetary missions to detect molecular species of interest in the field of planetary science. Such spectrometers featuring quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) include the Tunable Laser Spectrometer on the Mars Curiosity Rover and the future Venus Tunable Laser Spectrometer [1]. Through the process of four-wave mixing, a QCLs can behave as frequency combs (FCs), emitting modes which are ideally equidistant infrequency spacing [2]. QCL FCs simultaneously exhibit two desirable qualities for spectroscopic applications: broad spectral emission and narrow linewidths of individual modes. However, dispersion within the laser chip material degrades the performance of such spectrometers. Compensating for this dispersion provides a route to improving spectrometer performance [3], [4]. With this improved spectral performance, QCL FCs can better meet the specifications required of a spectrometer for space-based applications. The work described in this proposal will investigate applying dispersion compensation to a quantum cascade laser (QCL) operating as a frequency comb (FC). Here, dispersion compensation will be implemented by incorporating components such as a coated mirror or reflective grating within an external cavity (EC) [5]–[7]. In addition, the use of adaptive optics such as a MEMS mirror within the EC will be investigated as well [8]. The goal of these designs is to apply the opposite phase change to the radiation field as what is introduced by dispersion on the QCL chip. Deliverables of this work will include a design of the EC which optimizes the QCL FC emission spectra for spectroscopic applications, and the performance of a spectrometer in which this EC QCL FC serves as the laser source.

62,Theoretical and Experimental Investigation of Quantum Noise Induced Sensitivity Limit of a Fast Light Ring Laser Gyroscope,"In a Fast-Light Ring Laser Gyroscope (FRLG), the group index is vanishingly small. The Sagnac effect induced shift in the resonance frequency of each of two counter-propagating lasers, for a given rotation rate, is amplified by a factor equaling the inverse of this group index, compared to that for a conventional ring laser gyroscope (RLG). This scale factor enhancement coefficient (SFEC) can be as high as a million. If the quantum noise limited uncertainty in the laser frequency for an FRLG is the same as that for an RLG for otherwise identical operating parameters, this would imply that the factor of enhancement in measurement precision (FEMP) for an FRLG is the same as the SFEC. However, based on analogy with similar effects in a parity-time symmetric system, it has been suggested that the quantum noise limited uncertainty for an FRLG may be larger than that for an RLG, due to the so-called Petermann factor, thereby reducing the FEMP to a value smaller than the SFEC. We will carry out theoretical as well as experimental work to establish the maximum possible value of the FEMP that can be achieved under experimentally achievable conditions. In one track, we will carry out two new types of theoretical modeling for the FRLG to determine how the FEMP varies as a function of the operating parameters: one based on propagating the field using a quantum-enabled finite division time domain technique in the presence of random spontaneous emissions of photons, and the other based on re-ordering the operators in the temporal correlation function. In the second track, we will use a robust version of a Rb based superluminal laser, which employs a cavity enclosed in a vacuum chamber and highly stabilized pump lasers, to measure the value of the FEMP. The measurements will be compared with the theoretical models, and used to guide modifications thereof until agreement is achieved. This will pave the way for further refinement and miniaturization of the FRLG in Phase II.

63,Theoretical and Experimental Investigation of Quantum Noise Induced Sensitivity Limit of a Fast Light Ring Laser Gyroscope,"In a Fast-Light Ring Laser Gyroscope (FRLG), the rotation induced shift in the frequency of two counter-propagating lasers is amplified by the inverse of the group index, compared to a conventional ring laser gyroscope (RLG). This scale factor enhancement coefficient (SFEC) can be as high as a million. If the uncertainty in the laser frequency for an FRLG is the same as that for an RLG for otherwise identical conditions, then the factor of enhancement in measurement precision (FEMP) for an FRLG is the same as the SFEC. However, it has been suggested that the frequency uncertainty for an FRLG based on a pair of coupled resonators may be larger than that for an RLG, due to the Petermann factor (PF), thus reducing the FEMP to a value smaller than the SFEC, and possibly to unity. Theoretical investigation in Phase I has shown that when such an FRLG is operated far above threshold, it may be possible to achieve a value of FEMP significantly larger than unity. We will carry out theoretical as well as experimental work to establish the maximum possible value of the FEMP that can be achieved for such an FRLG, employing intracavity gain in one cavity and intra-cavity loss in another, using Raman transitions in Rb. In addition, we will investigate another type of FRLG in which a single ring cavity supports two counter-propagating lasers, without any cross-coupling, also realized using Raman transitions in Rb. For each laser in this system, the nature of the eigenvalues indicates that the FEMP would also be limited by the PF. However, it is not yet clear whether the PF exists in this case. We will explore ways to resolve this issue theoretically, by using the approach of Langevin noise operators. If the PF does not exist, it would indicate that for such an FRLG the FEMP can really be as larger as the SFEC. If the PF does exist, then we will identify conditions under which the FEMP in this case can also be much larger than unity when operated far above threshold.

64,Photonic antenna coupled middlewave infrared photodetector and focal plane array with low noise and high quantum efficiency,"Middle-wave infrared (MWIR, 3-5 ¿¿m) photodetectors are of great importance in numerous NASA applications, including thermal remote sensing for carbon-based trace gases (CH4, CO2, and CO), heat capacity mapping for earth resource locating, environment and atmosphere monitoring, and IR spectroscopy. However, existing MWIR photodetectors are require a low operating temperature, below 77K to achieve high photodetectivity (D*). The requirement for cryogenic cooling systems adds cost, weight and reliability issues, thereby making it unsuitable for small satellite applications. This STTR project aims to develop a new photonic antenna coupled MWIR photodetector with a significantly enhanced quantum efficiency. In addition, the antenna technology would also allow a large-area signal collection with a small active area of the detector. Successfully developing the proposed innovation is expected to provide an enabling technology for ultra-compact high performance MWIR detection and imaging systems suitable for NASA's small satellite earth remote sensing applications. In phase I, the proposed photonic antenna enhanced MWIR photodetector technology will be evaluated and compared with existing technologies. The proposed photonic antenna structure will be simulated to generate an optimal design. A preliminary photonic antenna coupled MWIR photodetector will be developed for proof-of-concept demonstration.

65,Molecular Ro-vibrational Collision Rates for Infrared Modeling of Warm Interstellar Gas from Full-dimensional Quantum Calculations,"We propose to compute accurate collisional excitation rate coefficients for rovibrational transitions of CS, SiO, SO, NO, H_2O, and HCN due to H_2, He, or H impact. This extends our previous grant which focused on 3- and 4-atom systems to 4- and 5-atom collision complexes, with dynamics to be performed on 6-9 dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs). This work, which uses fully quantum mechanical methods for inelastic scattering and incorporates full-dimensional PESs, pushes beyond the state-of-the-art for such calculations, as recently established by our group for rovibrational transitions in CO-H_2 in 6D. Many of the required PESs will be computed as part of this project using ab initio theory and basis sets of the highest level feasible and particular attention will be given to the long range form of the PESs.  The completion of the project will result in 6 new global PESs and state-to-state rate coefficients for a large range of initial rovibrational levels for temperatures between 1 and 3000 K. The chosen collision systems correspond to cases where data are limited or lacking, are important coolants or diagnostics, and result in observable emission features in the infrared (IR). The final project results will be important for the analysis of a variety of interstellar and extragalactic environments in which the local conditions of gas density, radiation field, and/or shocks drive the level populations out of equilibrium. In such cases, collisional excitation data are critical to the accurate prediction and interpretation of observed molecular IR emission lines in protoplanetary disks, star-forming regions, planetary nebulae, embedded protostars, photodissociation regions, etc. The use of the proposed collisional excitation data will lead to  deeper examination and understanding of the properties of many astrophysical environments, hence elevating the scientific return from the upcoming JWST, as well as from current (SOFIA, Herschel, HST) and past IR missions (Spitzer, ISO), and from ground-based telescopes.

66,Design and Analysis of Deep Subwavelength Featured Integrated Photonics for Aerospace Applications in Harsh Environments,"Research Significance: The revolution of research in silicon photonics has enabled innovative commercial applications for light- based signaling technologies including data communications, sensors, medical diagnostics, and photonic quantum computers. Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) enable strong performance benefits, especially due to the ability to transmit wavelength-divided multiplexed signals at light-speed. For PICs to be included in space missions and NASA technologies, several key factors must be addressed. (1) Size, weight, and power (SWaP) considerations must be improved. (2) Advanced design techniques for high performance must be developed to address growing data and sensing throughput demands. (3) PIC reliability in the harsh radiation and temperature-variable space environment must be established. This proposal aims to develop advanced integrated photonic component design and qualification techniques aimed at novel space applications (e.g. satellite communications, in-situ spectroscopy, quantum communications), leveraging mine and my group’s work generating intense light-matter interactions in dielectric media with deep subwavelength-featured photonic crystals (PhCs) and the study of radiation degradation mechanisms on commercial PIC components. NASA TA 5.1.7, 8.3.3, and 10.4.1 are addressed by developing high-performance integrated photonics with reduced power consumption and footprint in communications and sensor platforms, which will greatly improve spectroscopic analysis and data transmission in space. Central Objectives: This work seeks to develop high-performance PIC components integrated with subwavelength-featured PhCs, such as modulators, sensors, and nano-optical traps that can achieve never-before realized performance and great reductions in SWaP. With a focus toward studying PICs with state-of-the-art performance for space applications, I will study degradation mechanisms in the harsh radiation environment in space. Potential failure modes may include ionizing effects of trapped charges near active components, accumulated phase mismatches between RF and optical high-speed lines, perturbation effects due to single event transients in areas of intense optical energy concentration, and operation instability due to thermo-optic perturbations. I will address the fundamental objectives of (1) developing advanced component-level design techniques for realizing high-performance integrated photonics and (2) identifying key strategies and considerations for ensuring robust and tolerant operation in space. Using novel qualification standards for cutting-edge photonic elements in harsh environments, I will establish methodologies for engineering optical modes at the nanoscale and designing robust high-performance PIC components. Proposed Techniques (*listed methods are accessible at Vanderbilt University): Device fabrication will be performed via existing collaboration with GlobalFoundries through the 45 nm photonics team and the university multi-project wafer program. Predictive simulations of optical modes (finite-difference time-domain, eigenmode) and charge carrier profiles (charge transport) will be performed to inform device design and fabrication layout as well as to predict potential performance and failure mechanisms due to radiation and temperature. Experimental characterization will be conducted using existing transmission spectroscopy and network analyzer setups. To experimentally monitor the effects of transients, displaced atoms, and rogue charges in oxides and /or active regions, experimental radiation sources to study response due to incoherent X-rays, heavy ions, and pulsed laser excitation will be leveraged. Hermetically sealed packaging and liquid cooling will be considered for testing space-relevant temperatures. Step-wise and in-situ monitoring will be performed to uncover time-resolved and active operation degradation mechanisms.

67,Entangled Photon Transceiver Leveraging Photonic Integrated Circuit Technology,"The development and scaling of a nationwide fault-tolerant quantum network is of crucial interest to both the domestic and international scientific community. To achieve large scale quantum networks, quantum teleportation, the technique in which quantum information (a.k.a. qubits) is transferred between a sender and receiver, needs to be realized in a low-cost, size, weight and power (low-CSWAP) form factor. Extending quantum teleportation technology to photonic integrated components, which significantly reduces CSWAP and increases environmental stability can allow for a scalable space-deployable quantum network. A key component to this system is the entangled photon-pair source. Recent developments in quantum communications have successfully demonstrated quantum communications link in space by the Chinese Micius satellite for quantum studies and quantum communication. Freedom Photonics is exploring photonic integrated circuit (PIC) solutions for entangled photon sources in satellite applications. The PICs that will be developed here will allow the low-CSWAP implementation of high-brightness quantum transmitters in LEO satellites to allow for enhanced quantum communications. Photonic quantum communication devices currently have stringent system level requirements that are still being explored. Freedom Photonics LLC and our RI team member are partnering to combine high-performance photonic technology for entangled photon sources.

68,Doppler-Compensated Integrated Photonic Time-Bin Entanglement Transceiver,"A quantum network based on quantum entanglement is a potentially revolutionary technology with anticipated applications, such as “blind” quantum computing and secure communications, as well as a host of yet-to-be-discovered uses. To realize the true potential of quantum entanglement, scientists and engineers need standardized and reliable hardware to transmit and receive entangled quantum states of light. A key component of this network will be entanglement distributions transceivers. These components will both generate pairs of entangled photons that can be sent to other nodes within the network as well as receive and analyze photons from other transceiver units. While fiber-based networks may be useful in the near-term, placing such transceivers within a satellite-based network—which is capable of long-distance networking—represents a major milestone for the development of quantum information technologies. Consequently, such components should be low size, weight, and power (SWaP) to be compatible with satellite transmission. To address this challenge, PSI will team with Prof. Paul Kwiat (University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign, UIUC) and develop a Doppler-compensated Integrated Photonic Time-bin Entanglement Transceiver using a photonic integrated circuit platform. This transceiver will become a standardized component that will facilitate the exploration of quantum-entanglement applications both terrestrially and for space-based missions.

69,Tunable Narrow-Band Bi-Photon Source in IR Spectral Region for Calibration of High-Performance Transition-Edge Sensors,"The overall goal of this NASA STTR mult-phase effort is to develop a compact fully integrated tunable narrowband bi-photon source operating in the visible/IR spectral region for calibration and characterization of high-performance transition-edge sensors (TES) arrays under development at NASA Goddard as well as other research facilities throughout U.S. The key innovation in this effort is combining waveguide-based spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) with onboard wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and mode filtering for efficient generation, wavelength sorting, and fiber coupling of narrowband photon pairs in the near-to mid-infrared (IR) spectral region. Phase I of this effort established the feasibility of this approach through demonstrating coincidence at the output of two arms of periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) chip with integrated wavelength division multiplexing (WDM). This approach is enabled by combining AdvR's expertise in fabrication, poling, and packaging nonlinear optical waveguides with the University of Illinois Urbana Champaigne's (UIUC) demonstrated experience with high precision photon counting and quantum optics. The outcome of this multi-phase STTR will significantly advance the state-of-the-art narrowband bi-photon sources for system calibration of single photon counting detectors and energy-resolving single-photon detector arrays in the mid-IR, near-IR, and visible spectral regimes.

70,"Combining InP and SiGe Technologies for Low Noise, Low Power Cryogenic Amplifiers suitable for Radio Astronomy Arrays and Quantum Applcations.","Future earth science and planetary science missions will require large pixels, highly sensitive radio astronomy receiver arrays. Recent breakthroughs in detector technology are leading this growth. To achieve the required sensitivities, the large number of pixels (thousands) in a receiver requires low noise, low power cryogenic amplifier arrays. Lower noise amplifiers result in higher sensitivity arrays. The capacity of cryogenic coolers is limited, requiring amplifiers to have a low power dissipation. Producing cryogenic amplifiers that has both low noise and low power is difficult. Today, cryogenic amplifiers are manufactured using either Indium Phosphide (InP) HEMT devices or Silicon Germanium (SiGe) BJTs. Amplifiers based on InP technology have noise temperatures as low as 1.5K with a power dissipation of 10 mW. SiGe based amplifiers have noise temperatures of 3-4K with a power dissipation of 300 uW. The noise temperature of an amplifier is primarily set by the first stage. The subsequent stages contribute very little to the noise of the amplifier. Therefore, combining InP and SiGe will result in the ultimate low noise, low power cryogenic amplifier. The ideal amplifier will have a InP first stage for low noise and a SiGe 2nd and 3rd stage for low power. The InP stage will be a discrete design for optimum performance. The SiGe stages will be MMIC based design for ease of manufacturing and low cost. Combining these two technologies will result in an amplifier with 2K or less noise with a power dissipation of 500uW or less. Imagine an antenna array of 1028 elements that has a power dissipation of 514 mW. This performance is possible with this innovation. Phase 1 will result in a design of a low noise, low power amplifier based on both theoretical and empirical measurements

71,Modeling multi-scale material response of foam core sandwich panels for MMOD protection against hypervelocity impacts,"Micrometeoroid and orbital debris pose a significant threat to the success of all NASA space operations. An effective class of shielding incorporates a foam core sandwich panel. Here, the incident particle fragments experience repeated shocks as they travel through the foam core, vaporizing as they strike individual foam ligaments. Unfortunately, physical validation is difficult to conduct and prohibitively expensive. This both limits the number of shield designs that can be evaluated and severely impedes the determination of optimal engineering safety factors. These urgent issues necessitate accurate numerical models appropriate for both the design and validation of new and existing shielding materials.  This work will result in multiple distinct, but related outcomes. One is a highly versatile structure generation tool, KICSS, that can build representations of metallic foams and compute their properties with finite element analysis. In the past, the inherently random structure of foam materials has significantly hindered the construction of accurate numerical models. Concurrently, another outcome is a physics-based (quantum-mechanical) understanding of how the properties of intrinsic foam materials evolve during service lifetime (i.e. repeated hypervelocity impacts). These two outcomes will be incorporated to produce more accurate inputs for established HVI models critical to a number of NASA missions.

72,Detectors for Hard X-ray Imaging Velocity Tomography of Supernova Remnants,"Cassiopeia A is a bright, nearby supernova remnant. It is unique in that it is the only known supernova remnant in which Ti-44 has been directly observed, but it is well understood that Ti-44 plays a key role in supernova dynamics. We observe the presence of Ti-44 in Cassiopeia A via hard X-ray spectral lines that arise from nuclear decay processes. The position distribution of Ti-44 was first imaged by the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescopic Array (NuSTAR) in 2012, but we now seek more fine-grained velocity information about the Ti-44 distribution. This will be critical for furthering our knowledge of the Cassiopeia A supernova dynamics and, more broadly, the formation of heavy elements in our universe. We propose the development of phonon-mediated and superconducting kinetic inductance detector (KID) technology as a means to achieve world-leading resolution in hard X-ray spectroscopy. This nascent technology requires dedicated research and development to reach the expected sub-0.1 keV FWHM resolution, an order of magnitude better than the detectors used in NuSTAR. My contribution to this effort will include designing, fabricating, and testing a KID device that could be loaded into a NuSTAR-like telescope; improving the fundamental limitation on our energy resolution by testing and implementing a quantum-noise-limited cryogenic amplifier into our readout electronics; and optimizing the material makeup of our devices by leveraging the unique physical properties of superconductors. In these ways, I hope to bring clarity to our understanding of Cassiopeia A and other supernova remnants in our never-ending efforts to explore the final frontier.

73,"Computational Technologies: ""An Assessment of Hybrid Quantum Annealing Approaches for Inferring and Assimilating Satellite Surface Flux Data into Global Land Surface Models.""","The objective of this proposal is to expand the research progress the investigators have made in developing Quantum Annealing algorithms that can contribute directly to supporting science related NASA Earth science mission products on the current Ames D-Wave 2X, but to also port and substantially extend these capabilities to the next generation D-Wave 2000Q, when and where available. In particular, having developed unique hybrid neural net algorithmic capabilities for the OCO-2 mission, we plan to expand our research to a broader class of Earth science mission data products and problems, namely calculating surface fluxes from other satellite data products and fusing these data for land surface model data assimilation This includes completing the development, testing and evaluation of Ensemble Quantum Kalman-filter algorithms applicable to current and planned Earth Science missions over the next two years and beyond. We will conduct extensive validation demonstrations of the potential of these D-Wave quantum annealing algorithms at ARC, which we believe will show significant scientific impacts and benefits, potentially more effective than what can be achieved with todays classical computers. It is our, and others, experience that NN optimization algorithms lend themselves especially well to quantum annealing architectures. If successful, this mission enhancing capability would lead to consideration of continued quantum computer technology infusion over the next four years for integration into an operational phase. As use cases, we initially focus on assessing the D-Wave quantum annealing capability to address (i) the Global Carbon Source and Sink budgets over land (ii) perform image registration for direct estimates of Vegetation Growth from Solar Induced Fluorescence employing a multi-satellite Triple Collocation NN quantum algorithm and (iii) conduct Data Information Fusion analysis of Satellite and In-Situ Sensor observations with Reanalysis Model Outputs. We will extend our 3-year OCO-2 data collection to 5-years to infer annual variations in quantum computed global gridded CO2 fluxes, and to the upcoming ISS based OCO- 3 if available in the next two years. We have successfully fitted a highly complex turbulent multivariate, non-linear ARM data set employing a feed forward and backward propagation neural net algorithm on a loosely coupled ARC D-Wave 2X system used as a co-processor accelerator with a remote cluster at UMBC for the general purpose computations. The algorithm performed thousands of samples and hundreds of epochs with two hidden layers. Utilizing these algorithms, we have shown that we can infer CO2 fluxes utilizing historical ARM data for training that is comparable with classic computers. We believe this is the first time one has successfully demonstrated that the D-Wave can perform feed forward regressions yielding comparable results to that obtained with classical computers by employing the D-Wave in such a hybrid algorithmic approach. In this follow-on proposal, we plan to completely couple the hidden layers, forming a Boltzmann Machine, as part of the feed forward algorithm and will test various methods for recalculating the training weights in the backward propagation, which should produce improved global optimizations. This could prove to be a unique quantum capability capable of improved global optimization not reasonably possible with conventional computers. We have added several additional Earth scientists to substantially broaden the quantum computational science scope of applications. Thus, if awarded, we expect to improve on the current TRL 3/4 quantum computing capabilities to achieve a TRL 5/6 by the end of the proposed solicitation, thereby moving quantum annealing computing well on its way towards operational infusion.

74,Entangled Photon Pair Source Based On Thin-Film Lithium-Niobate-On-Insulator Photonic Integrated Circuits,"Herein, PSI propose a system-on-chip (SoC) solution for an entangled photon pair source (EPPS) based on thin-film lithium niobate on insulator (TFLNOI) photonic integrated circuits (PIC). Using integrated photonic devices such as fiber coupler, waveguide, modulator, splitter/combiner and micro-ring, the proposed EPPS can generate and process the entangled photons with high efficiency and speed. In phase I effort, we will study and model the proposed EPPS at the system level and layout specs for key components and systems. We will develop the periodic poling process for the target TFLNOI platform. And we will design and experimentally demonstrate high-efficiency spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) photon pair generation at telecommunication wavelength toward the end of the phase I work. In addition, a variety of PIC components such as waveguide, splitter/coupler, switch, modulator and filter will also be investigated theoretically and/or experimentally leveraging other ongoing government funded projects. The end result of the phase I work includes a demonstrated SPDC structure on a TFLNOI substrate, a system model and a system PIC design leveraging PSI existing PIC components, which will pave the path toward a full SoC prototype in phase II. Based on our pioneer work in TFLNOI PICs development and with our successful experiences in commercialization of SBIR research efforts, PSI is poised to develop, package, qualify and commercialize the proposed EPPS chip for tomorrow’s quantum communication demands.

These """"paramps"""" exhibit ultra-low noise reaching the standard quantum limit (SQL), along with a very wide bandwidth and large dynamic range. Our study has two thrusts: a) demonstrate superior readout of an x-ray calorimeter array using a microwave (4-8 GHz) paramp and b) study a proof-of-concept millimeter-wave paramp (65-150 GHz) in an experimental testbed.  At the end of FY21, we will have demonstrated the basic operation of highly novel paramps. Ideally, we would pursue a 2nd year IRAD proposal to fully study a larger range of designs. If good performance is obtained this would justify a full system design of a prototype mm-wave receiver under a follow-on APRA proposal and testing on a ground-based or balloon-based system to verify performance for astronomical observations. We will also pursue separate APRA funding to mature the microwave amplifiers for missions such as Lynx and OST. Finally we will also pursue alternative funding in the “quantum-sensing” and “quantum information science” domains since these devices have many applications outside of NASA.

76,Towards a robust laser-based velocity and temperature diagnostic for deployment in hypersonic ground-test facilities and high-speed flight,"I propose to design and build an infrared laser-based sensor package to measure temperature and velocity near the aft-body of a spacecraft during reentry. The sensor’s measurements will be quantitative, calibration-free, and non-intrusive and sampled at over 100 kHz. This sensor aligns with NASA’s goals of non-intrusively measuring thermal and dynamic pressure loading during reentry. The sensor concept is adapted from nitric oxide (NO)-targeting Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS) diagnostics developed to characterize temperature and velocity in hypersonic ground-test facilities. Design improvements will target reductions in physical footprint, power requirements, and data requirements while improving sensor robustness. Early design iterations will be tested in high-enthalpy facilities in Prof. Ronald K. Hanson’s group at Stanford University, while later designs will be deployed to selected hypersonic ground-test facilities nationwide. The sensor will contribute to the characterization of selected hypersonic facilities’ freestream conditions during these validation tests. The final sensor package will be ready for integration onto a selected spacecraft, and mission identification and preliminary flight-vehicle integration will be completed near the project’s end. I will rely on the Hanson group’s world-class facilities and experience in developing laser-based diagnostics to develop this sensor. I will also leverage my extensive experience in both optics research and in spaceflight hardware design. Development progress will be aided greatly by mentorship from NASA engineers, particularly during the mission selection process and integration into the spacecraft. This sensor concept is easily extended in the future to use multiple lasers targeting a range quantum transitions and target species, which would extract further information and reduce measurement uncertainty. However, a single-laser measurement is proposed here to minimize design complexity, physical footprint, power and data requirements, and cost. A successful sensor would open the door for a new type of non-intrusive sensor for future spacecraft.

77,Realization of intelligent instruments through the integration of neuromorphic devices with gas sensors enabled by two-dimensional materials,"Scientific instruments are key to NASA missions and sensors are an integral part of such instruments. Developing sensors that are not only miniaturized in size, weight, and power (SWaP) but also offer intelligence will revolutionize scientific instruments of the future. In this project, we propose to investigate a new paradigm for intelligent instrument design by integrating neuromorphic devices with chemical sensors using nanomaterials including transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and graphene. Tasks 1 and 2 will address the fabrication, functionalization, and benchmarking of chemitransistors enabled by atomically thin TMDs and graphene. Within these tasks, we will depart from traditional sensing architectures that employ only two terminals by introducing a third gating terminal with electrostatic control over the semiconducting channel material. The addition of a gating terminal provides an opportunity for drastic improvements in sensor endurance while reducing the power requirements for normal sensing operation. Additionally, the chemitransistor architecture will be functionalized with novel nanomaterials including Carbon nanotubes (CNT), nanowires, quantum dots (QD), and other nanoparticles to realize improvements in the sensitivity and selectivity of the proposed sensing platform. The first two tasks will produce a population of ultra-low power sensors with varied receptive fields. Tasks 3 and 4 will focus on the fabrication of a highly miniaturized in-situ multi-sensor platform enhanced by bio-inspired hardware- based machine learning algorithms. An ensemble of on-chip probabilistic, Bayesian, and artificial neural networks created using neuromorphic hardware primitives will collect differently functionalized sensor output data and perform inference to vastly improve the selectivity of our sensing platform beyond the capabilities of any single chemitransistive sensor. To fully address the challenges set forth in section 10.4, ‘Sensors, Electronics, and Devices’ of the 2015 NASA Technology Roadmap, proposed tasks 1 through 4 will spur innovation at the material level, the device architecture level, and the computational circuit level. Enhancing the performance of scientific instruments will generate a greater science return for a given cost envelope in prospective space missions where the reduction of size, weight, and power is a crucial design consideration.

78,Low SWaP UHV chamber for atom interferometer,"The development and maturation towards space applications of atomic systems are needed to meet NASA’s interest in advancing quantum sensing technologies. Atom interferometers have unmatched precision for in-situ measurements of local gravity acceleration. The Size, Weight, and Power consumption (SWaP) of existing atom interferometers is a major obstacle for employing them in NASA missions. One of the main components of an atom interferometer is an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) system. UHV systems are typically the heaviest components of atom interferometers. A light, compact, and energy-efficient UHV system will be highly beneficial for NASA missions. Q-Peak is addressing the need for lighter, compact, energy-efficient UHV systems suitable for an atom interferometer. Within a successful Phase I program, Q-Peak experimentally proved the suitability of the Aluminum alloy (AlSi10Mg) as housing material for the UHV chamber. Aluminum alloy (AlSi10Mg) housing is capable of maintaining residual gas pressure well below 5×10-10 Torr. The AlSi10Mg alloy is 30% lighter than stainless steel. Q-Peak proposes to build a complete UHV chamber suitable for atom interferometry out of the AlSi10Mg alloy. The ability to machine AlSi10Mg using a 3D printing process removes the constraint of traditional manufacturing considerations that can further decrease the SWaP of the UHV system. Special attention will be devoted to the development of an energy-efficient and reliable alkali-atom source.

79,Design and Fabrication of Arrayed Waveguide Grating Using Ultrafast Laser Inscription,"The proposed project aims to use ultrafast laser inscription (ULI) technology to improve the fabrication flexibility and versatility of a critical photonic component, arrayed waveguide grating (AWGs). The fabricated AWGs can be directly integrated with other ULI-based photonics devices, such as waveguide lasers, photonic lanterns, and modulators, realizing monolithic transmitters. This direct on-chip integration will eliminate fiber-optic coupling and reduce both the time and cost associated with the traditional lithography fabrication method. Iterative design, simulation, and ULI fabrication of the building blocks for realizing an ULI-based AWG will be performed. Initially, straight, curved, tapered, and slab waveguides will be designed and simulated using photonics simulation software. The waveguides will then be fabricated using the ULI technology; the feedback obtained from the characterization process will be used to refine the simulation models and fabrication parameters to achieve the desired sub-system performance. The optimized design and simulation results for these building blocks will be used as the input parameters to design, simulate and fabricate a four-channel AWG with 400-GHz channel spacing at a center wavelength of 1550 nm. The ULI-based, low SWaP PIC technology will be useful for NASA in lidar receivers for new Earth Science measurements such as the detection of carbon monoxide, free-space laser communications, mid-infrared heterodyne spectroscopy, and astrophotonics for exoplanet detection. The non-NASA applications include spectroscopy, optical communications, and quantum computing. The offerors, Aktiwave LLC, and the research institution, Rochester Institute of Technology, are well-positioned to execute the AWG requirements and explore possible 3D integration with other photonic functions, such as photonic lanterns. The team has demonstrated ULI-based waveguides, beam splitters, and waveguide lasers on various material platforms.

80,"Low Size, Weight, and Power, High Gain 2D Material-Based Detectors for Mass Spectrometers","This project will develop low power, high intrinsic amplification 2D material ion detectors shown in Phase I to work as low mass, low volume detectors for mass spectrometry from the feasibility stage to working examples. Guardion’s proposed solution is to eliminate the need of high voltage electron multipliers utilizing patented 2D material-based ion detectors that provide intrinsic charge to current amplification values ranging between 1E6-1E9 A/C, and only require an operating bias of 0.1V. It further distinguishes between positive and negative ions, and works from atmospheric pressure through ultra high vacuum. Unlike conventional methods of detection used in mass spectrometry, our sensors will exploit a low-bias intrinsic quantum gain mechanism in nanomaterials to amplify the signal from trace amounts of ions. This eliminates the need for external amplification, eliminates high voltage requirements, and significantly reduces power consumption. We have shown that replacing sensors in a commercial residual gas analyzer with these detectors can sense trace gasses. We propose to modify two existing mass filter systems, one residual gas analyzer and one ion trap mass spectrometer with our detector assembly and demonstrate comparable performance to state of the art detectors while using 10,000x less voltage. We will then demonstrate sensor response to mass range, sampling rate, charge state, and ion energy. Finally, we will generate a demonstration and report assessing the sensor performance, benefits, and limitations with suggestions on what types of mass spec and missions would be benefitted for sensor adoption.

Resulting AR information and visual cues will be relayed to a handheld mobile device with portability to heads up displays (HUDs), and provide key, streamlined, and real-time navigational updates throughout important and mission-critical tasks and procedures. The software architecture will balance provision of relevant and meaningful data with rich AR visualizations, while limiting extensive non-essential feedback, in order to ensure effective, yet practical, operation. Pattern and feature recognition algorithms, including pre-processing delineation routines, 3-D coordinate tracking for feature recognition, utilities for mitigating scene clutter and primary error sources, and the innovative path optimization and localization strategies will be integrated into a prototype ARNAV application. The ARNAV framework will include access to all developed algorithms, database and mapping structures, processing architectures, and a user interface design for AR overlays. Phase I will focus on developing the associated algorithms and ARNAV software application for simulations and performance assessment in representative emulated testing, along with human usability evaluations, to establish accuracy and effectiveness measures for the system.

82,Development of Strained-Layer Superlattice (SLS) IR Detector Camera,"Strained Layer Superlattice (SLS) detectors are a new class of detectors which may be the next generation of band-gap engineered, large format infrared detector arrays with substantially higher quantum efficiencies than existing quantum well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs) and provide a competitive alternative to the current state-of-the-art mercury cadmium telluride and QWIP detector arrays. The anticipated advantages of SLS detector technology over existing IR detectors are: high sensitivity, band-gap tunable wavelength response (similar to QWIPs), warmer operating temperatures, array spectral uniformity (yet to be realized), high temporal stability, relatively low cost of manufacturing, scalability (to very large format arrays) and multiple vendor sources all contributing to higher performing scientific instruments. Previously, (in our FY12 IRAD ""Strained Layer Superlattice Infrared Detector Array Characterization"") we verified that these devices exhibit a dramatic increase in quantum efficiency (QE) over quantum well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs) and are approaching QE values comparable with mercury cadmium telluride and indium antimonide detectors. This a major technological breakthrough, yet before we embark on an expensive in-house program to design and fabricate SLS detectors it would be very valuable to build an IR camera system using the existing SLS array we currently have and perform experimental field tests. Strained Layer Superlattice (SLS) detectors are a new class of detectors. In our FY12 IRAD ""Strained Layer Superlattice Infrared Detector Array Characterization"" we verified that these devices exhibit a dramatic increase in quantum efficiency (QE) over quantum well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs) and are approaching QE values comparable with mercury cadmium telluride and indium antimonide detectors. The anticipated advantages of SLS detector technology over existing IR detectors are: high sensitivity, band-gap tunable wavelength response (similar to QWIPs), warmer operating temperatures, array spectral uniformity (yet to be realized), high temporal stability, relatively low cost of manufacturing, scalability (to very large format arrays) and multiple vendor sources all contributing to higher performing scientific instruments. Warmer and more stable focal planes lead to simpler instrument designs which result in higher reliability, longer mission lifetimes and reduced costs. In our FY12 IRAD we obtained a test SLS array and performed extensive tests to ascertain the veracity of researcher claims, as well as to assess the potential applications to NASA missions from a practical infusion standpoint. The most important result of that investigation was the verification of the (unexpected) very high QE. However, along with the dramatic improvement in QE we measured much higher dark current and the array was quite non-uniform. Before we embark on an ambitious in-house program to design and fabricate SLS detectors it would be very valuable to build an IR camera system using the existing SLS array we currently have and perform some local field tests. We believe that actual IR imaging of external environment scenery will prove most valuable.

84,Femtosecond Laser Inscription of 3D Waveguide Beam Splitters and Integrated Photonic Circuits for Mid-IR sensing,"We propose to develop a three-dimensional (3D) mid-infrared (mid-IR) Photonic Lantern (PL) based on femtosecond laser inscription (FLI) technology. FLI of PLs allows converting the atmospheric seeing-limited signals captured by the telescope into diffraction-limited signals. A linear arrangement of the single-mode outputs can be further realized to form the virtual input slit of a spectrograph. The inherent 3D nature, scalability, and the ability to integrate many on-chip functions make FLI an attractive fabrication technique for photonic integrated circuits (PIC), as opposed to the multi-step planar waveguide technologies relying on costly, large-scale microelectronics foundry techniques. The FLI of a 3D, 1x8, mid-infrared waveguide beam splitter and a 1x8 photonic lantern will be demonstrated during the project's Phase I and II period. Three technical objectives are defined: 1: Determine the optimum geometry for a 1x8 waveguide splitter. Objective. 2: Experimentally investigate the impact of laser parameters and WBS geometry on WBS performance. .and 3: Demonstrate a 1x8 waveguide beam splitter operating in the mid-infrared region. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to establish an FLI technology platform for fabricating integrated photonic circuits. The FLI-based, low SWaP PIC technology will be useful for NASA in lidar receiver for new Earth Science measurements such as the detection of carbon monoxide, free-space laser communications, mid-infrared heterodyne spectroscopy, and astrophotonics for exoplanet detection. The non-NASA applications include spectroscopy, optical communications, medical and clinical research, quantum computing, quantum information, and quantum metrology.

85,Photonic Integrated Circuit Assisted Single Photon Detectors (PICA SPDs),"Within this program, Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) will develop Photonic Integrated Circuit Assisted-Single Photon Detectors (PICA-SPDs) to increase the bandwidth and timing resolution of single-photon detectors (SPDs). Realizing low size, weight, and power (SWaP) SPDs with high saturation-rates and high timing-resolutions are critical for deploying of quantum technology in space. While the best superconducting nanowire SPDs (SNSPDs) can achieve saturation rates up to 100 MHz with timing resolutions of several 10’s of ps, these also require cryogenic environments, making their deployment in space a challenge. On the other hand, single photon avalanche photodiodes (SPADs) are low SWaP and can operate at room temperature with good efficiencies (>75%); however, the timing resolution is often 50 ps (or more) and the saturation rate is typically limited to 10s of MHz. To overcome the challenge of increasing both the timing resolution and saturation rate of SPAD arrays, our unique active-approach leverages high-speed, low-loss PIC modulators. Here, single-photon optical signals enter the PIC and are routed to a series of Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) switches. These fast, traveling-wave switches are driven by periodic signals having progressively higher frequencies to create a switch yard. As the photon stream enters each of the MZI switches, the different time-positions are routed to different outputs of each MZI, which isolates individual time-positions to enable readout using an array of SPDs. This approach enables an array of SPADs to operate together to achieve timing resolutions even surpassing SNSPDs with greatly enhanced saturation count rates to enable space-based quantum networking applications.

86,Developing Next-Generation X-Ray Hybrid CMOS Detectors for Future Observatories and Investigating Their Low-Energy Response,"The Lynx X-Ray Observatory and other next-generation X-ray observatories will require detectors with finer spatial resolution, faster read-out speeds, and greater energy resolution in order to meet their science goals of observing distant, faint objects in the nascent universe. These missions will also need detectors with high quantum efficiency (QE), the fraction of incident X-rays individually detected, in order to observe the fainter objects (e.g. young seed black holes) that drive the mission science cases. Hybrid CMOS Detectors (HCDs), a form of active pixel sensor, are promising candidates for use in the next generation of X-ray observatories due to their use of read-out integrated circuits (ROIC) in each pixel, allowing for much faster read-out, advanced read-out schemes, lower power consumption, and greater radiation hardness than detectors used in the current generation of X-ray observatories.  The Penn State X-Ray Detector Development Laboratory has designed two models of prototype HCDs which incorporate new technologies with the potential to enable the observational capabilities of future observatories. These detectors are the small-pixel HCD, whose small pixel size enables high-resolution observations, and the Speedster EXD detector, which incorporates event-driven readout and provides the potential for even faster read-out speeds than observed in other HCDs. While these prototype detectors have performed well at moderate energies (1.5 - 10 keV) and are known to have response at energies below 1.5 keV, they have not yet been fully characterized at low energies (0.2 - 1.5 keV). The low-energy efficiency of detectors in future observatories will be vital to their science goals, as the high-redshift quasars and gamma-ray bursts (with power-law spectra) targeted by these observatories are brightest at these energies.  This project seeks to both optimize and characterize the performance of these detectors in the low-energy band in order to guide the development of X-ray HCDs and raise the TRL of these technologies. I plan to measure the QE of these detectors at lower energies than previously measured on any model of X-ray HCD (specifically at 1.49, 0.53, and 0.28 keV) using a proportional counter to gauge the absolute flux, improve the performance of these detectors at low energies through optimization of detector and analysis parameters, and characterize the impact of environmental testing on their performance.  Characterizing the low-energy performance of these prototype HCDs is vital to further development of these detectors for use in Lynx and other future observatories. I will use these results to help guide the development of small-pixel and event driven readout technology in HCDs and to improve the low-energy performance of the next generation of HCDs.

87,Hybrid organic electro-optic modulators for silicon photonic integrated circuits,"Silicon organic hybrid (SOH) EO modulators are a leading potential solution to the limitations of silicon pn junction EO modulators, including poor modulation efficiency, high optical loss, and limited EO bandwidth, which constrain the performance of silicon photonics (SiPh) PICs. In SOH modulators, the tight confinement of optical and RF fields inside the organic EO (OEO) material, combined with their large Pockels effect (r33 ≤ 1100 pm/V), enable excellent modulation efficiencies (VπL ≥ 0.5 Vmm) bandwidths (≤ 100 GHz), and losses (phase shifter loss ≥ 1 dB). Such performance enables lower power, higher bandwidth, and more compact PICs than can be achieved with silicon alone, and the facile post-process OEO integration ensures CMOS compatibility. Introduction of SOH modulators into commercial SiPh platforms could dramatically improve the SWaP-CP of PIC systems for applications ranging from communications (datacom, telecom, satellite) to sensing (electric field, LIDAR, microwave/mmWave signal processing), to hybrid electronic-photonic digital computing. NLM Photonics proposes to work with AIM Photonics, formed by the USAF and the Research Foundation for SUNY as a Manufacturing Innovation Institute in the field of integrated photonics, to introduce SOH modulators into their 300 mm SiPh platform. NLM will design PICs with SOH EO modulators for fabrication under AIM’s multi-project wafer offering, to enable rapid, low-cost fabrication of devices for testing design parameters and optimization of OEO material integration within a Phase I program. Results from the initial devices will be used to optimize designs for a custom wafer fabrication under a Phase II program. NLM will also identify key technology questions that must be addressed for NASA applications, such as the long-term stability of materials, devices, and systems to the harsh operational conditions associated with space, and prepare experimental plans to address those questions in a Phase II program.

88,Cs Atom Interferometer Laser,"Quantum sensing takes advantage of the quantum mechanical nature of matters (e.g., atoms and ions) to boost the sensitivity of various sensors critical in NASA and other government/commercial applications. A stable, high-power, narrow-linewidth laser source is an essential subsystem needed in various atom-based quantum sensing. In atom-based sensing, high-power laser beams can generally increase the number of atoms, enhancing a metrology system's signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Although the principle of operation for atom interferometry (AI) applies identically for any atomic species, certain atomic species could be better suited for specific applications. However, although cesium is one of the most commonly used species in cold atom experiments performed in laboratory environments, field-deployable light-pulse atom interferometry with cesium is not often available in low SWaP (size, weight, and power) packaging due to the lack of a compact laser subsystem supporting the atom interferometry operation. To address the need, Opto-Atomics Corp. (OAC) proposes to develop a Cs Atom Interferometry Laser (CSAIL) that can be adopted in NASA's space-borne atom-interferometers with cesium in inertial navigation and other applications. The proposed development addresses NASA's call (S13.05) for a laser subsystem enabling Raman-based light-pulse atom interferometer with Cs. In Phase I, OAC will design and assemble key system components of CSAIL, evaluate their performance, and perform feasibility demonstrations. We will also conduct a preliminary design of the fully-packaged CSAIL system for future development.

89,"Luminescence Cryothermometry, Year 1","The proposed effort makes innovative use of luminescence thermometry to provide temperature mapping of surfaces at cryogenic temperatures that cannot be obtained by conventional thermal imaging techniques because of insufficient thermal radiation for detection at these temperatures. Two classes of high temperature sensitivity phosphors will be investigated for cryogenic temperature mapping: (1) transition-metal doped oxides with energy level gap tailored for cryogenic temperature sensitivity and (2) quantum dot phosphors with particle sizes tailored for cryogenic temperature sensitivity. A strategic choice of transition metal -doped oxides with very small energy differences between two excited electron energy levels will provide the desired enhanced temperature sensitivity at very low temperatures. The quantum phosphor candidates will take advantage of very recent development of quantum dots as nanothermometers and will be selected according to particle sizes that give greatest sensitivity at very low temperature. The full field noncontact temperature measurements will provide much less intrusive and more coverage than the discrete temperature measurements on cryogenic tanks currently obtained by discrete thermocouples or resistance temperature detectors.  The research plan will be perform temperature calibrations from 77 K (ℓN2) to RT for thermographic phosphor candidates that include Cr-doped Ga2O3 particles and CdSe quantum dots that have been selected for high temperature sensitivity at cryogenic temperatures. Temperature calibrations will be performed for at least three phosphor candidates by 3/31/21. The temperatue precision of luminescence lifetime vs. peak intensity ratio temperature measurements will be compared for the phosphor candidates. Paint formulations and application methods will be developed for the best performing transition metal doped oxide phosphor and quantum dot phosphors by 5/31/21. A culminating heat leak detection demonstration will be performed on a painted cryogenic tank with an intentional internal flaw by 9/30/21. At the end of the proposed effort, arrangements will be made to incorporate the best performing cryogenic thermally sensitive paint into cryogenic tank testing in the SMiRF facility where it would be used to identify and quantify undesirable heat conduction paths that are currently difficult to evaluate.

90,Field Programmable Short Wave Infrared Photodetectors,"We propose to advance the state-of-the-art in short wave infrared (SWIR) detectors to meet NASA’s needs for advancements in communications technology. Antimonide-based Type II Superlattice (T2SL) infrared (IR) detectors have made significant advances in the past decade. The interest in this technology stems from (1) the ability to tailor the T2SL bandgaps across the IR region and (2) the manufacturability of T2SL structures using III-V foundries and horizontal integration schemes. NASA researchers have been involved with efforts to develop T2SL IR detectors for a variety of space-related missions, both in communications and sensing. We propose to complete a fundamental feasibility study leading to a prototype of a single pixel, field programmable, SWIR photodetector. This detector will use antimonide-based T2SL materials as the absorber. This detector will operate at relative high temperature (above 250 K). Most uniquely, this detector’s voltage bias can be programmed to operate with either high dynamic range or high sensitivity. High dynamic range uses a low voltage bias (<1 V) and operates the detector in a standard PIN configuration. High sensitivity uses a high voltage bias (20 to 30 V) and operates in the linear amplification region of an avalanche photodiode (APD). The detector is engineered for high signal-to-noise operation in both modes. The user or the control software can adaptively trade off dynamic range versus sensitivity on the fly and in response to measured characteristics of the scene (for example, photon flux or noise conditions). This detector will work ideally with an emerging generation of readout integrated circuits that will control the voltage of pixels selectively, leading to a focal plane array (FPA) that can algorithmically decide the operational mode of each pixel. Because the band structure of T2SL materials is designed, we will be able to engineer a detector that meets all of these targets simultaneously.

91,"Database of Nucleon-Nucleon Scattering Cross Sections by Stochastic Simulation, Phase I","A database of nucleon-nucleon elastic differential and total cross sections will be generated by stochastic simulation of the quantum Liouville equation in the Wigner representation, incorporating innovations of: (1) antisymmetrization effects of spin ? nucleons in phase space; (2) the first order quantum corrections as a stochastic process for two-nucleon dynamics; and (3) a linked list algorithm to streamline and speed computing. Phase I will produce a prototype 4-dimensional phase space simulation of one dimensional spatial scattering, which will be extended in Phase II to three dimensional spatial scattering with a full 12-dimensional phase space model. Significance includes design of radiation shielding materials for manned NASA missions into deep space, where galactic cosmic rays pose a serious health hazard. Computer codes simulating nuclear transport through materials, with associated input databases of interaction cross sections, enable radiation risk assessment of shielding materials. The proposed database of nucleon cross sections forms a subset of the input database. The simulation may potentially be extended to generate databases for nuclear elastic, inelastic, and fragmentation cross sections. Commercial applications include radiation protection for humans on earth under hazardous conditions. The simulation also has applications to nanotechnology and quantum information technologies.

92,Megapixel Longwave Infrared SLS FPAs for High Spatial Resolution Earth Observing Missions,"Earth observing missions like NASA's LANDSAT Data Continuity Mission - Thermal Infrared Sensor (LDCM-TIRS) require greater spatial resolution of the earth than the ~ 100m provided by the current instrument. Improving resolution to the desired ~ 30m requires increasing the number of pixels on target from the current 640x3 to ~ 2048x3. The TIRS instrument contains 640x512 longwave infrared quantum well infrared photodetector focal plane arrays (LWIR QWIP FPAs) jointly developed by NASA/GSFC and QmagiQ. QmagiQ proposes to achieve the higher pixel resolution while simultaneously improving quantum efficiency and operating temperature by using antimony-based strained layer superlattice (SLS) detectors. A key challenge is dealing with the effects of reducing pixel pitch from 25 microns down to ~ 10 microns, viz. optical fill-factor, optical crosstalk, processing difficulties, pixel operability, etc. As a stepping stone in Phase I, we developed and delivered an SLS FPA with 1280x1024 format on 12 micron pitch that achieved record performance, viz. > 40% quantum efficiency and dark current half of MCT Rule07 for FPAs with cutoff wavelength > 11 microns. In Phase II, we will increase FPA format to 2048x2048 and push cutoff wavelength to 12-13 microns while still hitting desired quantum efficiency and operating temperature targets in consultation with NASA/GSFC. Several FPAs will be delivered to NASA for evaluation.

In this project, CFD Research Corporation (CFDRC) with University of California Riverside (UCR), Rochester Institute of Technology, and International Photonics  will: 1) develop and provide reliable, validated computational tools for assessment, design, and optimization of novel nanostructures based on Quantum Dots (QD) for future nano-devices for space applications; 2) investigate, design, and demonstrate new photovoltaic (PV) structures based on QD nanotechnology, with improved efficiency and radiation hardness. The inherently radiation tolerant quantum dots of variable sizes maximize absorption of different light wavelengths (""multicolor"" cell), which dramatically improves photovoltaic efficiency and diminishes the radiation-induced degradation.  Phase 1 included development of numerical tools for modeling electron-phonon transport in quantum-dot for photovoltaic applications, using experimental data from UCR Nano-Device Laboratory for validation and calibration of the models, computational and experimental proof-of-concept.  In Phase 2, the new QD models will be integrated into CFDRC's advanced photonic-electronic device simulator and used for further optimization of QD superlattices.

94,A Fiber-Based Microwave to Optical Transducer for High Sensitivity Broadband RF Receiver,"Radio astronomy is a field directly driven by advancements in space technology instrumentation. New discoveries will require compact, efficiently integrated radio/microwave frequency receivers with high sensitivity, low power, and high bandwidth. I propose to develop an optical fiber-based rare-earth ion microwave to optical photon transducer that could be utilized as the front end of a high sensitivity broadband RF receiver when coupled to the optical fiber-based superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) developed at NASA’s JPL. An optical-microwave transducer is a device that allows for the coherent conversion of electromagnetic radiation between optical and microwave frequencies. Our novel device design combines numerous individual quantum and classical subsystems to create an integrated on-chip architecture. The first vital component is placing the rare-earth ions inside a microwave and an optical cavity, which allows for strong coupling of the optical and microwave frequency transitions of the ensemble of ions to the cavities. The second vital component is the optical fiber nature of the transducer, which allows for a seamless interconnect with well-established optical fiber technologies and compact integration with JPL’s fiber-based SNSPDs. The device can be fabricated with known materials and design techniques and will be characterized and tested via established microwave and laser spectroscopy techniques. Proof of principle calculations were performed to show that the device can operate in the unit quantum efficiency regime. The visiting technology experience (VTE) of the NSTRF will allow me to capitalize on the JPL Microdevice Laboratories’ expertise in superconducting circuits and self-aligning optical fiber-to detector coupling that are crucial to our device. In addition the VTE will allow me to act as an ambassador between the University of Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory, and JPL in order to coordinate research projects and initialize long term collaborations at the forefront of single photon detector technology research and its application to radio astronomy and quantum communication. Successful realization of this quantum transducer can be seamlessly integrated with JPL technologies for extremely weak microwave radiation detection and possible further applications in RF Communications, radar remote sensing, and quantum communication and computing.

95,Monolithic Chip-Integrated Absorption Spectrometer from 3-5 microns,"A monolithically integrated indium phosphide (InP) to silicon-on-sapphire (SoS) platform is being proposed for a monolithic portable or handheld spectrometer between 3-5microns. SoS provides the necessary refractive index contrast to fabricate slotted photonic crystal waveguide (PCW) structures for lab-on-chip sensing. Monolithic integration of quantum cascade laser (QCL) and quantum cascade detector (QCD) has been previously demonstrated by us at 9.5 micron wavelength on a solely InP platform in which PCWs cannot be fabricated without significant fabrication complexities. At 3.4 micron wavelength, we have also demonstrated 1ppm gas sensing by slow light and intensity enhancements of slotted PCWs in SoS. The Phase 1 proposal takes the crucial step of wafer bonding to integrate the best capabilities of the individual platforms and integrate into a full-fledged monolithic absorption spectrometer. The work plan is thus to demonstrate the technical objectives which are: 1) Design and fabricate slotted PCWs at 4.55 micron 2) Demonstrate feasibility for sub 10ppb detection sensitivity in our slotted PCW at 4.55 micron in SoS for carbon monoxide 3) Demonstrate monolithic integration of quantum cascade laser, quantum cascade detector and silicon-on-sapphire waveguide at 4.55 micron and 4) Design simultaneous QCL-QCD structures for operation around the selected wavelengths at 3.3 micron (CH4), 4.2 micron (CO2) and 4.55 micron (CO) for fabrication in Phase 2.

96,High-Flux Ultracold-Atom Chip Interferometers,"ColdQuanta's ultimate objective is to produce a compact, turnkey, ultracold-atom system specifically designed for performing interferometry with Bose-Einstein condensates. To produce ultracold-atom-based devices (e.g. inertial sensors, magnetometers, clocks, etc.) that can compete with existing technologies, higher fluxes and/or faster production rates will be needed over current state-of-the-art techniques. In this Phase I work effort, ColdQuanta will address this need for greater fluxes by investigating two approaches toward developing high-flux compact BEC-producing systems. The first approach targets systems that utilize ColdQuanta's RuBECi vacuum cell and its proven success at the heart of the world's smallest, fastest-producing, ultracold atom systems. Using numerical optimization, we will improve the speed and efficiency (i.e. reduce atom loss) of several key production steps, including faster trap loading from a cold-atom source and more efficient atom transfer between magnetic traps. In the second, higher payoff approach, we will investigate implementation of assembly-line production of BECs using vacuum cell construction that allows each stage of production to occur simultaneously throughout a series of interconnected vacuum chambers. The resulting system would create ultracold atoms quasi-continuously and increase production rates by virtually eliminating dead time between sequential operating cycles.

97,Nanostructured Photovoltaics for Space Power,"The NASA NSTRF proposal entitled Nanostructured Photovoltaics for Space Power is targeted towards research to improve the current state of the art photovoltaic technology. A quantum dot nipi doping superlattice cell will be pursued with the objective of realizing an intermediate band solar cell (IBSC). The nipi structure is a novel design that depends on multiple n-type / intrinsic / p-type / intrinsic repeat units. Due to the multiple quantum wells formed through the thickness of the novel structure, lateral contacts are required, which can be made via epitaxial regrowth. With high doping levels, and close spacing between doped layers, quantum confinement occurs within the superlattice. This confinement creates states through which lower energy photons will be absorbed, although the unconfined bulk material is transparent at these energies. An additional benefit of the tightly spaced doped layers is that the entire region will be drift field dominated, and carriers will not be lost due to recombination prior to the much slower diffusion processes. This drift field dependence allows quantum dots to be located at any location within the device, while still allowing the carriers to be quickly extracted. This freedom in locating the quantum dots will allow them to be doped in such a way as to be half filled with carriers, which is an essential requirement for the IBSC.  With the realization of the IBSC, efficiency increases will be seen, with the possibility of reaching 46% under one sun AM0 illumination. The high efficiency that is attainable for this device structure will provide dramatic improvements in mass specific power, reaching 1169.9 W/kg at the cell level, which exceeds the NASA metric of 500 W/kg. Due to the drift field dominated device, a substantial boost to the radiation tolerance in the device is achieved, since a decrease in diffusion length will not negatively affect carrier collection. Radiation tolerance has been shown to improve for a nipi device, where the expected lifetime is 11.9 times greater than a single junction GaAs device, making it a good choice for the high radiation doses possible in space. The radiation tolerance, along with the ability to collect carriers efficiently through drift mechanisms instead of diffusion allows the design to function well for the high concentrations experienced in near sun missions. The work to realize the IBSC with the quantum dot nipi solar cell can be realized via a partnership between RIT and the NASA GRC. Significant accomplishments have already been seen through this partnership, some of which include the development of high quality quantum dots, nanowires, the preliminary work related to the nipi structure and the evaluation of the regrowth process. This partnership can be furthered through the NSTRF fellowship, and the synergies that will be created as RIT students interact more closely with the highly skilled NASA staff.

The Decadal Survey recommended missions, such as ASCENDS and GACM, to measure atmospheric constituents such as CO2, CH4, CO, O3, NO2, SO2, and CH2O.  However, as noted by the Decadal Survey, mid infrared solid state lasers needed for DIAL systems are not available. This program proposes a systematic search for novel mid infrared solid state lasers utilizing a quantum mechanical model and verifying results using spectroscopy.  Specifically novel mid infrared lasers will be sought to measure the atmospheric constituents noted above.  A 2 front approach is proposed.  On 1 front, Langley’s quantum mechanical model will be used, where applicable, to predict good laser materials.  On the other front, mid infrared spectrometers will measure both absorption and fluorescence spectra will to be analyzed.  This information will verify the quantum mechanical model predictions and serve as input parameters for laser models. A successful program ends with the identification of a good laser material for at least 1 of the listed atmospheric constituents and a measurement of its germane spectroscopic parameters.  The eventual goal is the demonstration of a mid infrared laser suitable for remote sensing work.

100,Miniature Laser System for Cs Atom Interferometer,"OEwaves Inc. offers to develop and demonstrate a compact diode laser system producing the wavelengths for operation of Cs based atomic sensor including Cs atomic interferometers. The system will include 852 nm and 894 nm lasers including modulation functions typically required for the operation of quantum sensors. The system will feature the properties required for long duration space applications. The system will be based on semiconductor lasers locked to monolithic microcavities using the self-injection locking technique. This technique results in a complete suppression of mode hops in the laser during its operational lifetime. The microcavity will not only stabilize the frequency of the laser but will also be used to measure and stabilize the power of the laser. The microcavity provides a modulatable laser that features exceptionally low residual amplitude modulation, allowing a robust lock as well as offset lock to the atomic transition of interest. The proof of principle validation of the technique has been demonstrated by earlier efforts at OEwaves. At the end of Phase II, our goal is to deliver a prototype that achieves better than 10-11/g acceleration sensitivity, and the required frequency stability (defined by the customer; varies depending on the laser use). A unique feature of crystalline WGM resonators pioneered by OEwaves is their high optical transparency leading to quality factors that routinely exceed 109. This will add to simplification in locking lasers to the modes of the resonator.

101,"Individualized, Noninvasive Speech Indicators for Tracking Elevations in Stress (INSITES)","The complexity and round-the-clock nature of NASA operations in low Earth orbit and future deep space missions, along with isolation in the hostile environment of space, can induce levels of acute and chronic stress that could compromise astronaut performance, leading to errors that could affect science payloads, crew safety and mission success. For the exploration of space a method is needed to assess operator state, quickly and reliably detect stress, and provide objective feedback to the individual, crew, and ground support, in order to mitigate adverse events and mishaps. We propose to develop a system that makes use of equipment that would be inherent to any spacecraft to identify Individualized, Noninvasive Speech Indicators for Tracking Elevations in Stress (INSITES). The goal of this INSITES project is to develop an unobtrusive, objective, and reliable detector of stress that measures changes in speech and vocalizations from equipment (microphones, communications systems, computers) used during operations, without requiring additional sensors or dedicated processing hardware. Under this project, Quantum Applied Science and Research (QUASAR) and the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC) will define features in speech known to indicate stress, develop algorithms to extract these features from recorded audio streams, and adapt QUASAR’s machine learning cognitive state classification software, QStates, to process these speech features in real-time from voice audio streams. We will create models for stress based on these features, and provide a real-time visual output describing an individual’s stress level. The team will also develop the plans for software or hardware integration for a completed tool for implementation in NASA spacecraft and habitats to detect changes in stress acutely and over time. Doing so could potentially provide an opportunity to assess and intervene before it adversely impacts mission safety, effectiveness, or success.

102,Optimized frequency-stabilization subsystem for a compact Rydberg laser package,"A primary critical hardware need that is common to all atomic quantum sensors – including atomic clocks, inertial sensors, gravimeters, and electromagnetic sensors – is laser and laser-frequency-stabilization subsystems for the specific manipulation of atoms and readout in the quantum sensor that is in a portable form factor and operational in real-world and harsh environments on sea, land, air, and space. Technical challenges remain to maintaining high frequency stability, frequency control, with lower SWaP form factors required for laser and frequency-stabilization subsystems while operating in real-world and harsh environments. In this effort Rydberg technologies will evaluate architectures for optimal atomic frequency-stabilization of a frequency-agile 510-nm coupler laser that uses electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) signal from a modulated alkali gas cell to both (1) frequency-stabilize the coupler laser to <100 kHz (10 kHz goal) during signal reception operation and (2) provide frequency-agility with wavelength tuning over nanometers to access Rydberg levels and S-band and K-band RF transitions. In this effort to realize QRR-ready multi-color tunable Rydberg laser packages, we will exploit the fact that atom-based vapor-cell saturation and Rydberg-EIT spectroscopies offer stabilization approaches that provide mechanical and thermal robustness, as well as compactness. These are critical features that cannot be met with SOTA ultra-stable cavity references. The proposed atomic Rydberg-EIT laser lock seamlessly dovetails with the QRR sensors and hybrid electrode-integrated vapor-cell detectors because both types of cells are similar and use the same atomic transitions, ensuring laser frequency locks that are drift-free and free of laser-frequency-shifting schemes that are complex and/or not sufficiently agile.

For the exploration of space, therefore, a method is needed to assess operator state, quickly and reliably detect stress, and provide objective feedback to the individual, crew, and ground support, in order to mitigate adverse events and mishaps.

QUASAR and the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC) will build a database of audio stress recordings acquired under laboratory conditions in order to construct normative models of stress, using vocal stress-related features identified in Phase I. A methodology for recalibrating normative models to individuals using minimal additional training data in order to optimize model performance will be developed. QUASAR will also prepare and validate an INSITES prototype that will provide a real-time visual output describing an individual’s stress level. The prototype will be based upon an app that can be readily installed on a mobile device or implemented in NASA spacecraft and habitats to detect changes in stress acutely and over time.

104,Tailoring the Solar Spectrum for Enhanced Crop Yield for Space Missions,"UbiQD, Inc, has partnered with the University of Arizona, Controlled Environment Agriculture Center, to enhance the lighting component of the Mars-Lunar Greenhouse prototype to improve the food production of the system. Ultimately, the goals are for UbiQD to install a down-conversion film composed of quantum dots (QDs) to not only provide higher quality PAR spectrum than currently using, but by converting the high concentration of UV photons to visible photons, UbiQD would dramatically increase the intensity of the PAR spectrum in space applications and provided to the plants and the quality of the spectrum will also enhance the efficiency of crop growth. In the Phase II project, we have been building on the successful phase I results and develop new light recipes for the QD-films to find the optimal spectra for lettuce and tomatoes, with a final goal to enhance biomass production for controlled environment growing on space missions. The Phase II work has already shown promising new light recipes that have increased yield improvements for lettuce compared to the Phase I results and improvements were also observed for tomatoes in a controlled indoor growth chamber. Greenhouse studies are also underway for the 625nm emitting film and a second greenhouse study is planned for a 650nm emitting film. For the Phase IIE proposed work, UbiQD will focus on integrating quantum dots into a lower cost, extrudable greenhouse film. The benefits of incorporating quantum dots into an extruded plastic, compared to a roll-to-roll process that is currently used is the ability to manufacture the film at lower cost/weight, but they can also be manufactured at larger sizes. This technology will benefit terrestrial applications by replacing current greenhouse covers with a yield boosting cover. For space applications, the lower weight plastic will be an improved solution for NASA and deployed as the cover of the Mars Lunar Greenhouse Prototype.

105,Development of InAlAs Top Cell for High Specific Power Multijunction Photovoltaics,"The semiconductor material InAlAs has the potential to improve upon current space photovoltaics in a number of ways. InAlAsSb lattice-matched to InP would operate as the top cell in a triple-junction design with an AM0 efficiency of 37.1%, a cell-level mass specific power >1000 W/kg, and panel-level mass specific power of 662 W/kg. Development of InAlAs for engineered substrates would result in a lattice-matched triple-junction cell with a 1-sun AM1.5 efficiency of 40.4%. Additionally, InAlAs lattice-matched to InP has the appropriate bandgap for operation in low-intensity low-temperature conditions. Development of these proposed photovoltaic cells is particularly warranted since the InP materials system is known to be exceptionally radiation tolerant, which is ideal for space operation. Furthermore, lattice-matched cells are lighter and more mechanically stable than their metamorphic counterparts. The technology proposed in this application would increase capability and durability for missions needing onboard power or electric propulsion, and would also correspond to technology gains for terrestrial concentrator photovoltaic systems.  The materials proposed in this study have undergone little to no development. Development of these materials would occur via semiconductor growth methods of metal organic vapor phase epitaxy or molecular beam epitaxy. Growth conditions such as temperature, gaseous precursors, and gas ratios can be adjusted to target desired material properties. This research would initially focus on materials development. Once the desired material are grown, they can then be fabricated in complete photovoltaic cells and tested for radiation and temperature tolerance which are important considerations for space applications.

106,"Novel Solar Cell Nanotechnology for Improved Efficiency and Radiation Hardness, Phase I","Significant improvements in photovoltaic materials and systems are required to enable future exploration missions. This SBIR project, involving two innovative organizations: CFD Research Corporation (CFDRC) and University of California Riverside (UCR), has two major objectives: 1) develop and provide reliable, validated computational tools for assessment, design, and optimization of novel nanostructures based on Quantum Dots (QD) for future nano-devices for space applications; 2) investigate, design, and demonstrate new photovoltaic (PV) structures based on QD nanotechnology, with improved efficiency and radiation hardness. The inherently radiation tolerant quantum dots of variable sizes maximize absorption of different light wavelengths (""multicolor"" cell), which dramatically improves PV efficiency and diminishes the radiation-induced degradation.  Phase I includes development of numerical tools for modeling electron-phonon transport in QD superlattices for photovoltaic applications, using experimental data from UCR Nano-Device Laboratory for validation and calibration of the new tools, and computational proof-of-concept. In Phase II, the new QD models will be integrated into CFDRC's advanced photonic-electronic device simulator. Novel QD photovoltaic nano-engineered materials and designs will be down-selected for further development to the point of testable prototypes. They will be fabricated and provided to NASA for electrical characterization and radiation testing.

107,CMOS Photon-Counting Image Sensor with High Spatial Resolution and Room Temperature Operation for High-Performance Visible-Blind UV/EUV Photon Number Resolving,"In this proposed project, we plan to complete the further research and develop of a novel platform solid-state image sensor, Quanta Image Sensor (QIS), for future NASA missions, and other scientific, industrial, and consumer low-light, photon-counting applications. The outcome of this project is a visible-blind UV/EUV photon-counting quanta image sensor with high-speed and accurate photon-counting capability without the necessity of electron avalanche multiplication. The sensor will have a linear multi-bit photon-counting response, among other exciting features, such as up to ~100% duty cycle, zero dead time, low dark count, low operating voltage and power consumption, large format with high spatial resolution, room temperature operation, high quantum efficiency in UV/EUV wavelengths, and strong radiation tolerance. The ultimate goal of this project is to produce a Quanta Image Sensor (QIS) with enhanced quantum efficiency (QE) in UV/EUV wavelengths and high radiation hardness. The R&D work in Phase I provides a fundamental base for this development, and the real device design and fabrication will be completed in Phase II of this project. During Phase II, a second-generation QIS test chip will be designed, fabricated, and tested. The new test chip will serve as a plat-form to demonstrate the proposed new technologies that will bring necessary features to the future NASA applications. If successful, the test chip will significantly improve the readiness level of the QIS technologies and their implementation in NASA applications. A lot of exciting experiments and validation can be conducted based on the test chip both in a laboratory environment and in some space-relevant environments. A camera/imaging system will be built surrounding the new test chip to satisfy the requirements of those validation and experiments.

108,CMOS Photon-Counting Image Sensor with High Spatial Resolution and Room Temperature Operation for High-Performance Visible-Blind UV/EUV Photon Number Resolving,"In this proposed project, we plan to further develop a novel platform image sensor, Quanta Image Sensor (QIS), for future NASA missions, and other scientific and consumer applications. The outcome of this project will be a large-format visible-blind CMOS UV/EUV photon-counting sensor with accurate photon-counting capability. The novel sensor will provide some capabilities that are not available with other high-sensitivity detectors, such as accurate photon-number-resolving, zero dead time, low voltage and power requirements, high spatial resolution, and room temperature operation. These features will benefit multiple future NASA missions such as the ESA-NASA Solar Orbiter, Large UV Optical Infrared Survey Telescope (LUVOIR), and the Habitable Exoplanet Mission (HabEx). The core of QIS is the specialized CMOS photon-counting pixels, called “jots.” With our patented innovations, jots can accurately count photons without the use of avalanche gain or cooling. The technology was validated in a 1Mpixel prototype. The accurate photon-counting capability was demonstrated with ultra-low read noise and dark current at room temperature. When combined with the existing advanced back-surface passivation techniques and band-pass filters developed for CCDs and standard CMOS image sensors, a visible-blind QIS with high quantum efficiency in UV/EUV wavelengths can be produced. The ultimate goal of the project is to produce a QIS for high-performance visible-blind photon-counting in the UV/EUV spectral region. The effort in Phase I can provide critical guidance for the prototype design in Phase II. The anticipated results are (1) a detailed manufacturing plan for combining the future QIS products with the advanced back-surface passivation techniques, (2) an optimized jot designed for higher quantum efficiency and less cross-talk especially with short photon absorption depth, and (3) a preliminary plan on modifications required for the radiation hardened detector and circuit design.

109,Cold Atom Source System,"ColdQuanta's goal is to deliver a Cold Atom Source System (CASS), the critical core of next generation quantum-enabled technologies. Nearly all cold atom sources employ same few building blocks: an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) chamber with sufficient optical access for laser cooling, a laser system to deliver the appropriate light to the package, a set of optics for beam steering and shaping, and a set of magnetic field generating elements. To target a platform which can enable the largest spectrum of applications, ColdQuanta’s strategy is to develop a full requirements-based understanding of a device with performance that meets or exceeds the anticipated requirements of the most challenging application. To enable to widest possible existing and future applications, CASS will deliver a cold atom population to the user in excess of 5E8 atoms with a loading rate exceeding 1E9 atoms/s with a temperature below 50 microKelvin. ColdQuanta will make use of the SWaP advantages of our ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) Channel Cell technology in CASS. Channel Cells utilizes a silicon-and-glass construction and allows direct integration of precision optical components, as well as all necessary UHV system components, such as a miniature ion pump. By fabricating the system from glass and silicon we can shrink the size of the vacuum system from several liters to only a few tens of cubic centimeters, while maintaining a nanoTorr vacuum. Furthermore, the monolithic construction provides a high-performance package that is sufficiently robust for demanding environments. The other critical enabling low SWaP technology is the HAL laser delivered by Vescent Photonics, which produces widely tunable light (up to 10 GHz) with a fractional frequency instability of <1E-11 in 1 second. This laser module (w/ electronics) has a volume < 500 cubic cm and consumes 15 W power. The CASS will produce MOTs with lifetimes of more than 100 s in a 10L rack mountable system while drawing below 30 W of power.

110,"Turn-key Near-Infrared Photon-Counting Detector Module for LIDAR Applications, Phase I","We propose to design and deliver a turn-key photon counting detector module for near-infrared wavelengths, based on large-area InGaAs/InP avalanche photodiodes (APDs) that have been optimized for photon counting.  The detector module will incorporate all of the essential photon-counting detector system elements: thermoelectric cooling, high-speed bias gating and avalanche quenching circuits, power supply, control and signal interfaces, optical fiber input, and a large-area APD.  Previous near-infrared photon-counting systems have been severely limited by the use of commercially-available telecommunications-grade APDs, designed for linear operation at room temperature and low internal gain.  These APDs are far from optimum for single photon counting at reduced temperature and very high internal gain. Work by our company has demonstrated that both quantum efficiency and pulse jitter can be greatly improved using APDs developed specifically for photon counting.  During Phase I we will develop and deliver a prototype photon counting detector module optimized for low jitter and high single-photon quantum efficiency at wavelengths between 1.0 and 1.6 microns.  During Phase II we will deliver a more advanced detector module having interchangeable APDs individually optimized for photon counting in the 1.0, 1.5, and 1.9 micron wavelength bands.

The detector design and advanced processing technologies combined with the unique material property of 4H-SiC are expected to lead to orders of magnitude improvements to the performance of large area solid state detectors including much lower noise due to the wide bandgap and substantially improved lifetime due to the greatly increased radiation tolerance in comparison to state-of-the-art solid state EUV-soft X-ray detector technologies. In Phase II, detectors and 2D arrays will be designed and fabricated. Eight batches will be fabricated with different detector sizes and different active abs thicknesses. Concentration will be focused on achieving very low dark current and high quantum efficiency based on a novel design. The fabricated detectors and 2D arrays with different optical window sizes will be characterized, including dark current, forward current ideality factor, quantum efficiency. The dominant source and mechanism of the dark current will be investigated to help identify approaches to further reduce the dark current in the privately funded Phase III which will be concentrating on pushing up the yield over 3"" wafer for commercialization within one year after the completion of Phase II.

This innovative photocathode and the technology of its growth on the Si microchannel plate enables us to meet NASA requirements for high quantum efficiency, low noise, radiation-hard, reliable, and potentially low cost solar-blind photodetectors. The large size and high number of microchannels offers superior spectral and spatial resolution for future NASA space instruments involved in the investigation of the origin of Universe, planet finding, and understanding Sun-Earth interactions while simultaneously improving the sensitivity of new instruments and avoiding an expensive increase of their cost due to optical system size. In Phase I, POC will demonstrate the feasibility of fabrication of AlGaN nanowire photocathodes for NW-Si-MCP detectors by fabricating the photocathode samples and demonstrating their quantum efficiency in the spectral range from 100 nm to 200 nm (TRL level 4). In Phase II, POC plans to develop a fully functional NW-Si-MCP prototype and demonstrate its long-term operation in harsh conditions (TRL level 6).

			(CAL)","The Cold Atom Laboratory (CAL) launched in 2018 produce clouds of ultra-cold atoms called Bose-Einstein Condensates (BEC’s), a bizarre state of matter in which atoms behave less like particles and more like waves. On the International Space Station, free from the pull of gravity, scientists are able to observe BEC’s for much longer than what is possible on Earth, and reach even colder temperatures than what is typically achieved on the ground. To make CAL a reality, technology improvements were implemented to reduce the size of the hardware necessary to create BEC’s, and to make it sturdy enough to survive the trip to space. Inside the Cold Atom Laboratory, the atom clouds are chilled to about 10 billionths of a degree above absolute zero, or about 10 billion times colder than the “average” temperature of deep space (typically cited as about 3 Kelvin). This feat is achieved via a 3-step process that begins with using lasers to corral the atoms and slow them down, stealing their energy and reducing the temperature. Radio waves then push away the warmest atoms, and the cloud’s expansion into very weak atom traps further reduces its temperature. In a BEC, the atoms form a single quantum wave state, and become indistinguishable from one another; this state of matter is not thought to form naturally in the universe.

115,"Manipulating the Toughness of Rocks through Electric Potentials, Year 1","When rocks are stressed, electronic charge carriers are activated which are defect electrons in the oxygen anion sublattice, O– in a matrix of O2–, known as positive holes. They have properties such as the ability to flow out of the stressed volume and spread into the surrounding unstressed rocks. The wave function associated with these charge carriers is highly delocalized, meaning that the spin density is distributed over hundreds of O2– neighbors. We conducted three sets of experiments to test the prediction that a specific quantum mechanical effect, the delocalization of the electronic wave functions associated with oxygen anions in the 1– valence state, has a measurable effect on fundamental properties of rocks. Normally the O– exist in the structure of rock‐forming minerals in the form of tightly bonded O–pairs, called peroxy defects. We set out to measure (i) the ""softening"" of rocks in which peroxy defects are activated, (ii) our capability to manipulate the distribution of the electronic charge carriers, called positive holes, that arise from the delocalized O– states, and (iii) the volume expansion predicted to accompany the break‐up of peroxy bonds and delocalization of the wave functions. We successfully demonstrated (i) and (ii), showing a ""softening"" of the rocks on the order of 10‐15%. We did not yet successfully demonstrate the volume increase effect. The mechanical properties of materials, including rocks, are influenced by many factors. Most prominent among those factors are defects on different scales. They range from point defects on the scale of atoms to linear defects within grains such as dislocations, 2‐dimensional defects along grain boundaries, and larger defects such as microfractures. The many forms of imperfections can be summed up as ""damage"". Damage is usually accumulative but can often be ""repaired"" through various annealing processes. In this project we have pursued a particular form of imperfections due to point defects in the oxygen sublattice of minerals, whereby oxygen anions have changed their valence from the usual 2– state to 1–. Under certain conditions point defects that consist of pairs of O– become activated. As the O––O– bond breaks up, there is strong evidence that the wave functions associated with the O– become delocalized over many neighboring oxygen anion position. As we show in this Report this quantum mechanical process of delocalization has a measurable effect on the mechanical properties of rocks: it makes rocks mechanically weaker and softer.

116,"High Efficiency, Deployable Solar Cells","Ultrathin, lightweight, flexible, and easily deployable solar cell (SC) capable of specific power greater than 1kW/kg is the target of this development and are at an early stage of development for NASA's future missions. Quantum dots and carbon nanostructures are employed, along with conducting polymers. The achievement of a broad photovoltaic spectral absorption is desired to yield high efficiency and power density. The unique optical absorption properties of quantum dots and the high conductivity of carbon nanostructures will allow the solar cell to operate at voltages greater than the bandgap of traditional photovoltaic materials. To date, initial, rudimentary optoelectric devices have been successfully fabricated. Devices were first fabricated on rigid substrates for ease of manufacture. These devices show enhanced photoconductivity, indicative of efficient photo-excitation and charge transfer between the QDs and polymer, which is crucial for the production of solar cells (SCs) from these materials. Plots of the current versus voltage are used to characterize the operation of SCs. The total film resistance decreases under illumination because photo-excited carriers are efficiently separated at the interfaces between the polymer and QDs. Device fabrication was then executed on flexible substrates. The optical absorptions of quantum dot/polymer blends were observed under ultraviolet illumination and the photocurrent responses were observed to be similar to that of the devices fabricated on the rigid substrates. Next steps include investigation of other conductive polymer systems. Optimization of blends containing ligand-stripped QDs will be sought. Uniform dispersion of the QDs into the conductive polymer is necessary. The optimal QD/conductive polymer system will be selected and design of the appropriate novel architecture will commence. The first approach will be the fabrication of multi-junction layers, followed by the design of patterned structures. Architectures will be designed in order to optimize photoabsorption, improve charge separation, and increase charge extraction.

117,Atomic drag-free accelerometer for non-gravitational forces in radiometric orbit determination and planetary science measurements,"We propose to further advance the technology maturity of the miniature atomic drag-free accelerometer that was first developed under the Planetary Instrument Definition and Development Program (PIDDP). The accelerometer uses free-fall atomic particles as proof masses and quantum wave interference for inertial force measurements. This novel type of accelerometer will provide unprecedented performance in both sensitivity and stability on-board an orbiter without the need for calibration. The accelerometer measures all of the non-gravitational forces of the spacecraft and thus enables the reduction and elimination of the errors induced into the planetary gravity measurements through radiometric orbit determination. Radiometric gravity measurements have provided unique and valuable information about the interior structure and dynamics of planetary bodies. The confirmation and determination of the fluid core size of Mars are great examples of the science achievable from gravity measurements. For other planetary bodies, where non-gravitational forces are severe and dynamic, an on-board accelerometer will provide the drag-force measurements necessary for obtaining high precision gravity data. The need and benefit of such accelerometers are exemplified by the inclusion of the Italian Spring Accelerometer on Mercury Planetary Orbiter in the BepiColombo mission. The atomic accelerometer instrument technology is based on the quantum atom-wave interferometers. It utilizes quantum interference of neutral atoms, laser cooled to microKelvin temperatures without bulky cryogenics. One major difference of the atomic accelerometer from traditional mechanical accelerometers is the use of totally free-fall proof masses without any spring or measurement back action. This allows for drag-free measurements, and therefore, high acceleration sensitivity and stability without the need of on-board calibrations. Through the PIDDP program we have demonstrated the concept of a miniature drag-free reference instrument, developed from a previous full rack-sized instrument to a simple and shoebox-sized sensor system. The objective of the MatISSE effort is to develop an integrated instrument system to TRL5, perform full characterization and evaluation on the ground, and make it ready for microgravity performance demonstration and validation. With the successful development and validation of the atomic accelerometer technology, future missions to orbit Titan, Enceladus, and Venus will be able to carry the precision U.S. accelerometer. This will enhance gravity measurements by enabling the orbiter to fly low in altitude, for higher gravity signals, without the concern of atmosphere drag-induced errors. With better measurements of gravity higher harmonics and tidal variations, scientists will be able to learn more about the density distribution in depth, shape, and the interior structure of a planet body in hydrostatic equilibrium. For planets with heavy atmospheres such as Venus, one may be able to determine the seasonal atmospheric loading through time-varying gravity measurements.

118,"A Near-Infrared Photon Counting Camera for High Sensitivity Astronomical Observation, Phase II","The innovation is a Near Infrared Photon-Counting Sensor (NIRPCS), an imaging device with sufficient sensitivity to capture the spectral signatures, in the wavelength range 0.9-1.7 um from very faint extra-solar targets and events with high resolution.  The NIRPCS will have near zero read noise and dark rates below the read noise to support photon counting for frame capture times as high as 10 seconds.  Up to 10/5 frames can be sequentially captured and digitally averaged.  Important NASA applications for the NIRPCS include spectral measurements on extra-solar planets in search of water and bio-markers and measuring the dynamics of galaxies at high redshift to better understand the formation process.  The technical objectives of Phase II are centered on more focused study on the behavior of the TE photocathode at the very low cooling temperatures anticipated for the ultimate implementation of this sensor technology by NASA for the astronomy application. The modeling results of the Phase I effort showed that reduction of the electric field in the InP, due to applied cathode bias, reduced the bias dependant hole avalanche and absorber generation contributions to the cathode dark current. Factors of 3.8x and 48.2x reduction in dark current resulted for two redesigned cathodes at an operational temperature of 200K and +2V cathode bias. This occurred by redesign of the epitaxial structure in which the p-doped cap layer was eliminated. However, too much reduction of the electric field in the InP may also reduce the escape probability of hot electrons in the InP to vacuum thereby reducing quantum efficiency. Therefore a technical Phase II objective is to execute a design of experiment (D.O.E) to determine the best epitxial design for maximum quantum efficiency and reduced dark current.

119,"Nanostructured InGaP Solar Cells, Phase II","Current matching constraints can severely limit the design and overall performance of conventional serially-connected multijunction solar cells.  The goal of this SBIR program is to enhance the operating tolerance of high efficiency III-V solar cells by employing nanostructured materials in advanced device designs.  A larger fraction of the solar spectrum can potentially be harnessed while maximizing the solar cell operating voltage by embedding thin layers of narrow band gap material in a higher band gap matrix.  Nanostructured devices thus provide a means to decouple the usual dependence of short circuit current on open circuit voltage that limits conventional solar cell design.  While previous experimental work on quantum well or quantum dot solar cell devices has typically employed GaAs as the wide band gap matrix, we take a different approach, instead employing InGaP as the barrier material.  During the Phase I effort, we observed that thin InGaP layers can be extremely effective at reducing the dark current.  A novel device structure resulted in over a 100 mV enhancement in the open circuit voltage of GaAs PIN diodes solar cells without any degradation in the short circuit current.   The Phase II program will aim to further optimize single-junction nanostructured InGaP solar cells and then utilize these cells as building blocks to construct robust, multijunction photovoltaic devices with power conversion efficiencies approaching 40%.  Ultimately, the technical approach employed in this program has the potential of achieving conversion efficiencies exceeding 50% with a single p-n junction device, enabling improved overall performance and lower manufacturing costs.

120,High-power terahertz lasers with excellent beam quality for local oscillator sources,"Many molecular species that compose the interstellar medium have strong spectral features in the 2-5 THz range, and heterodyne spectroscopy is required to obtain ~km/s velocity resolution to resolve their complicated lineshapes and disentangle them from the background. Understanding the kinetics and energetics within the gas clouds of the interstellar medium is critical to understanding star formation processes and validating theories of galactic evolution. Herschel Observatory's heterodyne HIFI instrument provided several years of high-spectral-resolution measurements of the interstellar medium, although only up to 1.9 THz. The next frontier for heterodyne spectroscopy is the 2-6 THz region. However, development of heterodyne receivers above 2 THz has been severely hindered by a lack of convenient coherent sources of sufficient power to serve as local oscillators (LOs).   The recently developed quantum-cascade (QC) lasers are emerging as candidates for LOs in the 1.5-5 THz range. The current generation of single-mode THz QC-lasers can provide a few milliwatts of power in a directive beam, and will be sufficient to pump single pixels and small-format heterodyne arrays (~10 elements). This proposal looks beyond the state-of-the-art, to the development of large format heterodyne arrays which contain on the order of 100-1000 elements. LO powers on the order of 10-100 mW delivered in a high-quality Gaussian beam will be needed to pump the mixer array – not only because of the microwatt mixer power requirement, but to account for large anticipated losses in LO coupling and distribution. Large format heterodyne array instruments are attractive for a dramatic speedup of mapping of the interstellar medium, particularly on airborne platforms such as the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), and on long duration balloon platforms such as the Stratospheric Terahertz Observatory (STO), where observation time is limited.  The research goal of this proposal is to demonstrate a new concept for terahertz quantum-cascade (QC) lasers designed to deliver scalable continuous-wave output power in the range of 10 to 100 mW or more in a near-diffraction limited output beam: a chip-scale THz quantum-cascade vertical-external-cavity-surface-emitting-laser (QC-VECSEL). We focus here on the development of a chip-scale version of size < 1 cm3 that oscillates in a single mode and can readily fit on a cold stage. The enabling technology for this proposed laser is an active metasurface reflector, which is comprised of a sparse array of antenna-coupled THz QC-laser sub-cavities. The metasurface reflector is part of the laser cavity such that multiple THz QC-laser sub-cavities are locked to a high-quality-factor cavity mode, which allows for scalable power combining with a favorable geometry for thermal dissipation and continuous-wave operation. We propose an integrated design, modeling, and experimental approach to design, fabricate, and characterize amplifying reflective QC metasurfaces and QC-VECSEL lasers. Demonstration laser devices will be developed at 2.7 THz and 4.7 THz, near the important frequencies for HD at 2.675 THz (for measurements of the hydrogen deuterium ratio and probing past star formation), and OI at 4.745 THz (a major coolant for photo-dissociation regions in giant molecular clouds). High resolution frequency measurements will be performed on a demonstration device at 2.7 THz will using downconversion with a Schottky diode sub-harmonic mixer to characterize the spectral purity, linewidth, and fine frequency tuning of this new type of QC-laser.  This proposed laser is supporting technology for next-generation terahertz detectors.

121,Superconducting Traveling-Wave Kinetic Inductance Amplifiers for Detector Readout and Other Applications,"We propose to continue work to develop the Traveling-wave Kinetic Inductance Parametric (TKIP) amplifier, a versatile new superconducting amplifier with properties enabling a number of new instruments for astronomy that would be used in NASA missions. The main characteristics of this amplifier are exceptional sensitivity, closely approaching the limits imposed by quantum mechanics, and very broadband operation. Versions of this concept may be implemented for operation at frequencies throughout the microwave and millimeter wave bands to potentially above 1 THz with octave bandwidth. Additionally the amplifier would have a high saturation power, while dissipating very little power itself. These properties make the TKIP well suited for a number of applications in the area of detectors and detector arrays for astronomy. In the microwave band, the application we target is the multiplexed readout of detector arrays. For example, the TKIP is an ideal readout amplifier for arrays of Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs), a technology that is being vigorously pursued for large detector arrays for wavelengths from the millimeter band to X-rays. The sensitivity of these detectors is ultimately limited by the noise of the readout transistor amplifier, which is a factor of ?20 above what is achievable with the quantum-limited amplifier that we propose. The sensitivity of the TKIP amplifier would also be sufficient for a direct frequency-domain multiplexed readout for Transition Edge Sensor (TES) arrays, which could significantly improve the multiplexing factor for these detectors beyond what is achievable with current SQUID systems. For this project, we will concentrate on developing a practical microwave band version of TKIP that could be supplied to astronomical instrument builders for improving the sensitivity of MKID arrays or for TES multiplexing. We will explore the TES readout application using sensors embedded in microwave frequency resonators. Finally, we will begin to explore higher frequency operation of the TKIP by developing a W-band version of the device.

122,A Novel Approach of Sensitive Infrared Signal Detection for Space Applications,"Develop an innovative frequency up-conversion device that will efficiently convert the infrared signals into visible/near-infrared signals to enable detection of infrared signals with high sensitivity, high dynamic range, fast response, and low noise background. We propose an innovative approach to overcome the infrared signal detection difficulties.  In this investigation, a Periodical Poled MgO Lithium Niobate (PPMgOLN) based frequency up-conversion devices will be developed to efficiently convert the infrared signals into visible/near-infrared signals which can be sensitively detected by well-developed superior silicon avalanche photodiodes (Si-APD). This innovative device will allow detect infrared signals with high sensitivity, high dynamic range, fast response, and low noise background.        The principle of up-conversion device is based on non-linear interaction btween two optical beams.  When a strong pump beam  and a weak probe beam interact in a suitable nonlinear crystal, a signal at third frequency is generated under the condition of energy and momentum conservation. For example, interaction between a pump beam at 1.06µm and weak infrared 2.05µm beam in the PPMgOLN crystal can generate photons at 0.7µm wavelength. The number of probe photons is much smaller than that pump photons because the probe beam is usually very weak. Only a small portion of pump photons have the chance to mix with probe photons to generate photons at sum frequency of the pump and probe beam. Therefore, the circulating power in the crystal is constant because of the negligible pump depletion. In theory, every infrared probe photons can be converted into visible/near infrared photons   An intra-cavity pumped up-conversion device is designed to demonstrate the frequency up conversion capbility. One periodically poled PPMgOLN is used in this study.  A CW 808 nm diode laser is used to pump a Nd:YAG rod inside the cavity to generate the 1064 nm pump beam. The leakage of 1064 nm light is used to monitor the circulating intra-cavity pump power. A two-micron DFB laser was also aligned through the PPMgOLN to simulate the weak probe beam.  CaF2 dispersion prisms and laser line filters were used to separate the generated 700 nm photons from the photons at other wavelengths for accurate visible signal measurement.    The up-converted photons can be measured with Silicon Single Photon Avalanche Photodiode detector to take advantages of its high quantum efficiency and low dark current. Thus, extremely weak infrared signal can be measured with unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy.

123,Magneto-Inductive Communications for Ocean Worlds,"A mission to the under-ice ocean of Europa is one of the highest priority missions for NASA. Galileo magnetometer measurements and other observations suggest a deep layer of electrically conductive fluid beneath the surface. Concepts for a probe to melt through the 5 to 10 km thickness of briny ice to reach the buried ocean have been proposed. Model predictions for magnesium sulfide concentrations vary but a conductivity range between 0.1 and 3 S/m seems reasonable. Conventional communications links that rely on propagation of an electromagnetic field cannot penetrate - even if the sea ice conductivity is only 0.1 S/m. The electric field attenuation would exceed 100 dB/km even at very low frequencies. We propose “magneto-inductive” technology. Magneto-inductive signals differ from electromagnetic signals because the electric field is suppressed. The magnetic field is a non-propagating quasi-static field that can penetrate a highly conductive medium. And, the magnetic field can be modulated to encode information hence it can be used for communications. `But the magnetic field strength will degrade as distance cubed (independent of the medium so long as the medium is not magnetic) so a very sensitive receiver technology is needed to pick up the weak signal after penetrating several km of briny ice. We intend to develop a magneto-inductive communication system based on an extremely high-sensitivity superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) receiver and quasi-static magnetic field transmitter. Preliminary calculations indicate that we should achieve ≈kbps with a modest transmitter and relatively small antennas (coils) using a SQUID-based receiver. This effort represents a potentially disruptive communications technology to enable a mission to the Europa ocean and other ocean worlds.

124,"Novel Musculoskeletal Loading and Assessment System (MLS), Year 2","The 4 main objectives in this FY'17 effort include: 1) improve the MLS bar electronics by installing full inertial measurement unit (IMU) systems, load cells, and improved Bluetooth technology; 2) ruggedize the MLS and fabricate a telescoping bar design; 3) add sensorimotor assessment and countermeasures capabilities using the WalkasinsTM system; 4) develop a novel data processing platform to integrate sensor, load, and positional data to assess sensorimotor function and provide a surrogate measure of ground reaction force. Industry and academic efforts in the sensorimotor area are typically conducted in large laboratories and include ambulation tasks and balance challenges. Testing and training sensorimotor function during exploration missions, without treadmill availability for ambulation, and within limited volume provides a very unique set of challenges that is not currently being explored by other efforts. Development and testing results of this device will be shared with the HRP's Advanced Exercise Concept team and ISS Exercise Engineering teams, as it is directly related and informative for next generation exercise devices. This hardware development and integrated analysis of pressure sensor, IMU, and load data has tremendous potential beyond spaceflight as a tool for individuals inflicted with neuromuscular diseases and stroke patients.

125,"High Sensitivity, Radiation Hard InGaAs LIDAR Receiver for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)","NASA has a requirement for a large-area, high-quantum-efficiency, high-throughput optical receiver for ground-, air-, and space-based LIDAR systems. A radiation-hardened direct detection analog LIDAR receiver will be developed to address this need in the proposed STTR program. The rad-hard LIDAR receiver will be based upon a high gain (M > 1000), low excess noise (k ~ 0.02) InGaAs APD technology with high quantum efficiency (>80%) between 1000-1600 nm, deployed in a 61-element segmented array with a 600-um-diameter aggregate sensitive area. Segmentation of the detector area will minimize pixel capacitance, reducing amplifier noise and enabling GHz-class bandwidth. In Phase I, the proposed hexagonal APD array will be fabricated and hybridized to a custom fanout board for operation with discrete amplifiers. In the Phase II effort, a custom low-noise readout integrated circuit will be developed to mate directly to the hexagonal array, enabling higher sensitivity and higher bandwidth due to reduced interconnect parasitics. At the end of Phase II, the APD receiver will be integrated into a LIDAR test bed by the Electro-Optical Systems Laboratory at Georgia Tech for evaluation in a 6-month measurement campaign. Voxtel anticipates that its technology will enter the program at TRL=4, finish Phase I at TRL=5, and exit the Phase II program at TRL=7.

126,On-Demand Single-Photon Sources for Correlated Calibration of Single Photon Detectors,"To support ultrasensitive detection and measurement in NASA aerospace applications, the development of quantum sensing and measurement (QSM) plays the key role, which involves a wide range of technologies and instruments whose performance is not constrained by the boundaries of classical physics. Single-photon counting has become one of the core techniques in remote sensing, measurement, and optical communications. Thorough characterization of the detection capability of a single-photon detector is required for accurate QSM applications. Compared to the conventional radiant-power-measurement-based method, the photon-pair-based correlated approach, in which the detection of one photon heralds the other photon of the pair with certainty, is well suited for straightforward photon counting calibration. So far, the most widely used ‘workhorse’ for generating photon pairs have been dominated by parametric down-conversion, which, however is intrinsically probabilistic. Aiming at on-demand generation of photon pairs for correlated calibration of SPDs, Nanohmics, Inc. and Prof. Anton Malko’s research group at the University of Texas at Dallas, in collaboration with Dr. Jennifer A. Hollingsworth at Los Alamos National Laboratory, propose to develop high-brightness single-photon pair sources based on biexciton cascade of single colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals.

127,"Hole-Initiated-Avalanche, Linear-Mode, Single-Photon-Sensitive Avalanche Photodetector with Reduced Excess Noise and Low Dark Count Rate","A radiation hard, single photon sensitive InGaAs avalanche photodiode (APD) receiver technology will be demonstrated useful for long range space based optical telecommunications in the spectral range from 1000 to 1600 nm. The innovation is based on a linear mode (lm) single photon sensitive APD technology for which avalanche gain as high as M = 8000 has been demonstrated. Single photon detection efficiency (PDE) up to 80% has been demonstrated at 1064 nm, as well as maximum count rates in excess of 300 MHz. In the proposed effort, the dark count rate of these detectors will be reduced to the order of kHz while preserving PDE and maximum count rate. Detector dark current will be lowered by two orders of magnitude through implementation of the APD design using aluminum-free alloys with 100x lower trap density than the current design. In Phase I, a series of single element detectors of varying diameter, as well as small sized arrays, will be fabricated from the new aluminum-free material, and the corresponding decrease in dark count rate will be measured. In Phase II, radiation and lifetime testing will be repeated for the aluminum-free design, and large-area segmented detectors will be coupled to readout integrated circuits and demonstrated. Voxtel anticipates that its technology will enter the program at TRL=4, finish Phase I at TRL=5, and exit the Phase II program at TRL=6.

128,A Portable Source of Lattice-Trapped and Ultracold Strontium (PLUS),"We propose to demonstrate the portable source of lattice-trapped, ultracold strontium (PLUS) designed during Phase I. The device uses simplified and robust techniques for loading the traps, and directly leverages hardware already developed by AOSense. The simplified architecture for PLUS makes it amenable to future space qualification. When paired with a sufficiently stable local oscillator, PLUS can be operated as an optical lattice clock. Alternatively, the lattice-trapped atoms could serve as a starting point for producing quantum degenerate Sr gases for use in future sensor technologies or fundamental science studies. In the latter case, possibilities span explorations of artificial gauge fields to quantum information processing. A space-qualified standard with the expected PLUS-levels of performance could revolutionize deep-space navigation by allowing spacecraft to autonomously calculate their own timing and navigation solutions rather than relying on two-way links to Earth. Similar performance levels could enable an entirely new class of sensors capable of sensitive gravitational wave detection with single baseline optical interferometers. Significant technical risk has been removed from the Phase I design by heavily leveraging hardware and strategies already developed by AOSense on other programs and conducting Phase I technology validation for the new, PLUS-specific hardware. We will continue to incorporate new developments from related AOSense programs as appropriate to further reduce technical risk or improve device performance. The primary Phase II objectives are the construction, integration, and validation of the PLUS physics package and controller and the preparation of PLUS for integration with a cavity-stabilized clock laser.

129,Atomic Fine-Structure Diagnostic and Cooling Transitions for Far Infraredand Submillimeter Observations,"Some of the strongest emission lines observed from a variety of astronomical sources originate from transitions between fine-structure levels in the ground term of neutral atoms and lowly-charged ions. These fine-structure levels are populated due to collisions with e-, H+, H, He, and/or H2 depending on the temperature and ionization fraction of the environment. As fine-structure excitation measurements are rare, modeling applications depend on theoretically determined rate coefficients. However, for many ions electron collision studies have not been performed for a decade or more, while over that time period the theoretical/computational methodology has significantly advanced. For heavy-particle collisions, very few systems have been studied. As a result, most models rely on estimates or on low-quality collisional data for fine-structure excitation. To significantly advance the state of fine-structure data for astrophysical models, we propose a collaborative effort in electron collisions, heavy-particle collisions, and quantum chemistry. Using the R-matrix method, fine-structure excitation due to electron collisions will be investigated for C, O, Ne^+, Ne^2+, Ar^+, Ar^2+, Fe, Fe^+, and Fe^2+. Fine-structure excitation due to heavy-particle collisions will be studied with a fully quantum molecular-orbital approach using potential energy surfaces computed with a multireference configuration-interaction method. The systems to be studied include: C/H^+, C/H2, O/H^+, O/H2, Ne^+/H, Ne^+/H2, Ne^2+/H, Ne^2+/H2, Fe/H^+, Fe^+/H, and Fe^2+/H. 2D rigid-rotor surfaces will be constructed for H2 collisions, internuclear distance dependent spin-orbit coupling will be computed in some cases, and all rate coefficients will be obtained for the temperature range 10-2000 K. The availability the proposed fine-structure excitation data will lead to deeper examination and understanding of the properties of many astrophysical environments, including young stellar objects, protoplanetary disks, planetary nebulae, photodissociation regions, active galactic nuclei, and x-ray dominated regions, hence elevating the scientific return from current (SOFIA, Spitzer, Herschel, HST) and upcoming (JWST) NASA IR/Submm astrophysics missions, as well as from ground-based telescopes.

130,Large Area Topological 2D Materials for Spintronics and Energy Efficient Electronics,"This proposal seeks to develop a scalable large-area synthesis method with precise thickness control for WTe2 and MoTe2 Wey semimetal thin films for next generation electronics that are spin-polarized and low-energy-dissipative. The exotic topological properties predicted in these Weyl semimetals can enable electronic devices critical for space-faring missions, such as quantum devices that are robust against noise and fluctuations and high-speed electronics that are immune to the harsh radiation in space.  Despite these promises, a synthesis method that can grow large-area WTe2 and MoTe2 thin films with precise thickness control from monolayer to several layers is lacking. While chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is widely used to grow many two-dimension (2D) materials, CVD growth of WTe2 and MoTe2 remains challenging. We propose industry-compatible atomic layer deposition (ALD) as a growth method to synthesize the Weyl semimetals with thicknesses from monolayers to several layers. The proposal builds upon our preliminary results that showed successful conversion of ~ 1 cm2-area ALD-deposited WO3 thin films to ~ 8 layer-thick WTe2 thin films. Four research aims are proposed: 1) Synthesis of WTe2 and MoTe2 monolayers and thin films via tellurization of ALD-deposited WOx and MoOx, 2) Investigation of the effects of a capping layer and substrate on transport properties of WTe and MoTe2 3) Wafer-scale transfer of the synthesized films to arbitrary substrates, and 4) Realization of the quantum spin Hall state in the monolayer WTe2 and MoTe2. Possible research experiences with NASA technologists include conducting research at the microfabrication facility(JPL) to develop high quality capping layers or study the radiation effects on the electronic properties of WTe2 and MoTe2. The broad impacts of the proposal is to realize large-area topological thin films that can be a material platform for future electronics, including NASA-specific electronic devices.

131,Heat Transfer Mechanisms for Flow Boiling in Microgravity using Fluorescing Materials as Temperature Sensors,"I propose an experiment to study two-phase flow boiling in microgravity. Obtaining a fundamental understanding of the nature of flow boiling fluid mechanics and heat transfer in space environments will allow more compact and efficient heat exchangers to be used in space. The experiment will be conducted using high-speed CCD cameras to record HFE 7100 flowing through a transparent sapphire tube test section. The inner wall of the tube will be lined with a transparent conducting polymer film that can be electrically heated. Quantum dots will be dispersed along the bottom half of the polymer film. Quantum dots fluoresce when excited with blue or UV light, and the intensity of their emission decreases with increasing temperature. The goal of this experiment is to track the intensity changes of the quantum dots with the CCD cameras in order to obtain a temperature distribution along the inner wall of the test section while the polymer film is heating the fluid. This temperature data can be used to obtain values for local heat transfer for the test section. Ground-based experiments will be tested first in order to confirm the validity of this method with respect to current flow-boiling correlations. The experiment apparatus will be optimized by mass and volume in order to increase feasibility of being able to run on either a parabolic flight or the International Space Station. Performing the temperature acquisition in either of these environments will allow correlations to be made for flow-boiling in microgravity environments. The resulting data from this experiment will help develop more accurate correlations for space-based heat exchangers, allowing spacecraft to distribute heat and power more consistently.

132,Frequency agile heterodyne detector for submillimeter spectroscopy of planets and comets,"The primary objective of this proposal is the development of a planetary THz heterodyne sensor for molecular line spectroscopy in space, based on transitions between quantum states in semiconductor quantum wells, and that can operate at physical temperatures of 50 K to 70 K. This would be a major advance for deep-space planetary and cometary missions. To date, all other THz heterodyne mixers (usually developed, for astrophysics applications) have utilized superconducting materials, and thus required cryogens or a mechanical cooler for operation near 4 K. Such systems cannot be flown for an extended period of time or require substantial cooling power and are unsuitable for planetary missions. State-of-the-art (SOA) heterodyne receiver technology intended for planetary instruments is based on Schottky-diodes operating at ambient temperature, typically below 1 THz. The only submillimeter heterodyne instrument that has flown to another planetary body is the Microwave Instrument for the Rosetta Orbiter (MIRO). MIRO has performed spectacularly on the cometary mission having determined the abundances of major gases, the surface outgassing rate and the nucleus subsurface temperature. However, it is based on decades-old mixer technology and its operating range was limited to two bands: 190 GHz (189-192) and 562 GHz (548-581), with high noise temperature ~ 8,000 K single-side band (SSB) in the 562 GHz band. The proposed Tunable Antenna-Coupled Intersubband Terahertz (TACIT) mixer will be a big leap forward for planetary science in the wide THz range, which is rich with many spectral lines. Besides the much greater number of gaseous species becoming accessible, a TACIT-based receiver will enable the study of winds with sufficient velocity resolution and permit high-sensitivity thermal imaging of surfaces. TACIT mixer absorbs THz radiation power resonantly, via a transition of electrons from the lower energy subband to the higher energy subband in a quantum well (QW) engineered AlGaAs/GaAs based material. Electric gates control the energy separation between subbands and thus provide the possibility to tune the mixer's frequency. After the radiation is absorbed the detector operates as a hot-electron bolometer (HEB). That is, the radiation power heats the electron gas and a large bolometric response is observed since the resistance has strong temperature dependence. This mixer will have several revolutionary technological advantages including: • low noise temperature (~ 2,000 K [SSB]); • low required local oscillator power (~ 20 microwatts); • operating temperature obtainable with passive radiative cooling in space (50-70 K); • very broad frequency range (1-5 THz) tunable electrically. Beside the spectral coverage, the 'breakthrough' TACIT mixer will: • enable sensitive array receivers thus tremendously increasing the volume of data returned over the life time of a mission; • be frequency re-programmable in flight so it can address questions or conditions not anticipated pre-launch. A TACIT-based THz spectroscopic receiver can be used on a number of the missions mentioned in the 'Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013-2022.' It is relevant to the numerous mission concepts, e.g., NASA's Europa mission, Journey to Enceladus and Titan, Enceladus Explorer, VESPER (Venus), Martian Water Dynamics, Comet Explorer, Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, Titan-Saturn System, Jupiter-Europa Orbiter, etc. In the proposed 3-year task we will optimize the material processing and the embedded THz antenna circuit, and will demonstrate a fully operational laboratory receiver. At entry, the TRL = 2, at the exit TRL = 4. The TACIT development effort is collaboration between the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and University of California Santa Barbara with contributions from Princeton University and LongWave Photonics LLC. This work builds on a recent 1-year PIDDP funded effort in 2013.

133,"Integrated Zero-Emission Aviation (IZEA) using a Robust Hybrid Architecture
		
			(IZEA)","The proposed project is an academic-industry collaboration focused on achieving zero greenhouse gas emissions from commercial aviation by 2050. Avoidance of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and minimization of Nitric Oxide (NOx) emissions and contrails inspires novel hybrid hydrogen-electric propulsion architectures. In particular, our approach considers hybrid electric power generation via a combination of turboelectric generators and fuel cells using hydrogen with either ambient air or concentrated oxygen. Minimization of NOx emission, efficiency augmentation, and the need to accommodate high-power mission segments drive consideration of Liquid Oxygen (LO2) storage for use during the takeoff and climb phases of flight. Cryogens enable strategic use of superconductors to increase the power density of the turboelectric generators and power distribution system, and the presence of multiple temperature zones from 20 to 400 K offers unprecedented opportunities to increase efficiency via novel thermal management strategies employing thermal flow control. The project will establish design requirements for component technologies via system simulations using a realistic >100-passenger short-range aircraft with a 3000 nm mission profile as a scalable, hybrid wing-body distributed-propulsion platform. In particular, fuel cell, power electronics, motors, superconducting power transmission, cryogenic, and aircraft systems technologies will be advanced to meet the zero-emission target. A flexible testbed operating at liquid hydrogen temperatures will be constructed that leverages existing facilities in hardware-in-the-loop demonstrations to obtain validation data for system integration models, multi-disciplinary design analysis and optimization, and evaluation of trade-offs. The overall global warming potential of the entire fleet based on the scalable aircraft configuration will be evaluated. Ultimately, a refined understanding of viable pathways toward zero-emission for the aviation industry will emerge. University and industry experts in electric power, energy storage/conversion, propulsion, cryogenics, superconductivity, thermal management, motors, power electronics and distribution, and aircraft systems with an extensive collaborative history and unmatched capabilities and facilities are teamed in this effort.

134,Nanotechnology based X-ray Detectors for Space Observations,"X-Ray detector technologies that possess improved number of readout pixels, lower power, faster readout rates, greater quantum efficiency, and enhanced energy resolution are critical to space exploration and scientific research missions. This proposal identifies a transformative new approach for X-ray detection using ion-sensitive nanomaterials. Recent work has shown that certain nanomaterials are extremely sensitive to ionized gas molecules, which enables them to detect even individual ions. These sensors can be utilized as a core element within an ionizable gas-filled volume that responds strongly to X-Rays. This project proposes to develop self-standing X-Ray detector elements with higher quantum gain with reduced power consumption compared to conventional X-Ray detectors, without sacrificing readout speed and miniaturizability. This development will be carried out by an optimization of the ion-sensing core nanomaterial, the sensing geometry, and the ionizable front-end gas volume architecture. These optimized materials and architectures will be combined with low-power fast readout electronics at the back-end to form self-standing X-Ray detector elements. This project will combine the state-of-the-art in materials science, physics, detector technology, and electrical engineering to address an issue of enormous scientific importance and technical value. The successful development of such a detector element will enable the project to move into phase II, where prototype solar X-ray detectors with small independent pixels (< 250 µm) and fast read-out (>10,000 count/s/pixel) over an energy range from < 5 keV to 300 keV will be developed. This technology will have the reach to influence a number of NASA missions beyond Solar observation, such as deep-space imaging and navigation. It will also have a huge potential for commercial applications in industrial testing and process control, medical diagnostics, and advanced scientific research in materials science and beyond.

135,CMOS Photon-Counting Image Sensor with High Spatial Resolution and Room Temperature Operation for High-Performance Visible-Blind UV/EUV Photon Number Resolving,"In this proposed Phase II E/X, we plan on further developing the novel Quanta Image Sensor (QIS) imaging platform for use in future NASA missions as well as other scientific, industrial and consumer, low-light, photon-counting applications. The outcome of this project will be a UV/EUV photon-counting QIS camera module that is visible light blind and does not require electron avalanche multiplication. This sensor will have photon-number resolving capability in addition to low dark count rate and high quantum efficiency with high spatial resolution, large image format, low operating voltage and low power consumption. This technology will overcome the limitations of the previous technology by achieving this performance at room temperature, with ~100% duty cycle, strong radiation tolerance and zero dead time. The R&D work in Phase I provided a fundamental base for this development and gave a complete picture of the performance that was achieved with the previous generation of QIS detectors. During Phase II, a second-generation QIS test chip was designed, fabricated, and tested. The new test chip was able to demonstrate significantly improved performance both relative to the previous generation QIS device as well as the other devices currently available on the market. The work to be performed during this Phase II E/X will enable Gigajot to translate the successful R&D performed in Phase I and Phase II into a commercial product.

136,Chip-Scale Active Fast Light Gyroscope and Accelerometer using Integrated Photonic Technology,"The fast-light effect in a cavity, in the active or passive mode, has emerged as an important mechanism for enhancing the sensitivity of many devices. Recently, we have been investigating the development of gyroscopes and accelerometers using the active mode, in which the cavity is a Fast-Light Ring Laser (FLRL). Specifically, we have demonstrated, on a table-top, a pair of counter-propagating FLRL’s, with one of the cavity mirrors mounted on a metallic diaphragm, thus realizing an Active Fast Light Gyroscope and Accelerometer (AFLOGA). In this system, the anomalously dispersive gain is produced by a pair of Rb vapor cells, each containing two isotopes of Rb. We have seen an enhancement in sensitivity by a factor of nearly three orders of magnitude. In order to increase the sensitivity further, and demonstrate the corresponding improvements in the minimum measurable rates of rotation or acceleration, it is necessary to achieve quantum noise limited operation, by enhancing the robustness of the system. To this end, we here propose to develop a miniature AFLOGA, using chip-scale components at Rb wavelengths of 780/795 nm. The components include lasers, modulators, detectors, waveguides, and optical isolators, integrated on a single chip. GaAsP Quantum Wells (QWs) will enable the realization of the active photonic components. In sections for the passive components, the QWs would be disordered to minimize optical losses. A resonator containing two miniature vapor cells will be used as the cavity for the two FLRLs. The chip-mounted components will be interconnected with the cavity, as well as additional electronics on a printed circuit board. In Phase I, we will develop a detailed design of the chip-scale AFLOGA and demonstrate functionality of key components. In Phase II, we will demonstrate operation of an AFLOGA with a million-fold improvement in precision, and then use copies thereof to demonstrate a three-axes Fast-Light Inertial Measurement Unit (FLIMU).

137,GeSiSn PIN detector arrays for beam alignment in coherent Doppler LiDAR systems,"A key future earth science mission for NASA focuses on the global characterization of vertical profiles of horizontal wind magnitude and direction. The “3D Winds” mission targets both coherent and direct detection Doppler wind lidars to complement one another in a hybrid lidar system in low Earth orbit. Optimum performance of a coherent Doppler wind lidar system necessitates the use of an optical beam alignment architecture, such as one of those previously described. In this proposal, Freedom Photonics outlines a path towards improved optical alignment within an existing coherent Doppler lidar system at NASA Langley Research Center through the development of an inexpensive alignment detector system with high bandwidth and quantum efficiency, which is responsive at target wavelengths between 1.9 and 2.2 µm. Prototype Germanium Silicon Tin (GeSiSn) PIN detector arrays developed on a synergistic program are already responsive out to 2.2 µm wavelengths. Critically, the GeSiSn material can be grown directly on Si substrates, which are inexpensive to process and allow for growth on large-diameter wafers and thus large high-resolution arrays and/or large detector apertures. This program will leverage Freedom Photonics’s extensive experience in the design, fabrication, and manufacture of complex photodiodes and systems, as well as existing materials to support a rapid development effort. The overall goal of this SBIR program, through Phases I, II, and III, is to develop, transfer to manufacturing, qualify, and transition to NASA deployment, as well as other government and commercial markets, a low cost, radiation hard, high quantum efficiency shortwave infrared photodiode array using the GeSiSn materials system, grown on a Silicon substrate.

138,Lunar Super Low-Frequency Atomic Seismometer,"We propose to develop a super low-frequency atomic seismometer for lunar landers and network applications. The seismometer instrument employs using atomic test masses as the inertial reference frame and atom interferometry for displacement measurements.  The baseline technology has been investigated and demonstrated as a quantum gravity gradiometer for earth gravity measurements and an orbiter atomic drag-free reference instrument for planetary gravity measurements. Due to its reliance on the atomic system, the measurement system can be more stable over longer time period than its mechanical counter parts. Therefore, the atomic seismometer will provide unprecedented seismic sensitivity at frequency ranges from Hz down to µHz.   Seismology has been a key technique for understanding a planet and its interior. Seismic measurements have extensively provided unique and valuable information about the interior structure and dynamics of the Earth. Indeed, almost all first lander mission of a planet carried seismometers, including on the moon. The need and benefit of broadband planetary seismometers with low-frequency sensitivity are exemplified by the VBB instrument on the InSight mission. The potential for the atomic seismometer to achieve extremely high sensitivity and low noise at very low frequencies (sub-µHz) is vital for science on the moon, which is very quiet in comparison with Earth or even the activity levels predicted for Mars.  In particular, the low-frequency sensitivity of the instrument enables science beyond that achieved with the instruments from the Apollo missions, including long-period surface waves and normal modes at frequencies down to sub-mHz range and tide measurements in the sub-µHz range.   The atomic seismometer instrument is based on the principle of quantum matter-wave interferometry. It utilizes the interference of atom waves, with atoms laser cooled to microKelvin temperatures without cryogenics. One major difference of the atomic seismometer from traditional mechanical ones is the use of totally free-fall test masses without any spring mechanism or measurement back-action. This allows for high acceleration sensitivity and extreme measurement stability without the need for on-board calibrations. Through NASA ROSES programs, we have demonstrated a transportable atomic gravity gradiometer and subsequently miniaturized it into a shoebox-sized accelerometer sensor system. The objective of the DALI effort is to develop and mature an integrated instrument system of atomic seismometer specifically for moon deployment, perform full characterizations and evaluations, and make it ready to be infused into for a lunar lander mission.

139,Long Term In-Space Cryogen Storage - Magnetic Isolation,"A research activity is proposed to assess the feasibility of magnetic and/or quantum levitation techniques to hold cryogenic fluids in space for extended durations with a greatly reduced fluid boil-off rate.The proposed scheme would conductively isolate the tanks from warmer spacecraft structure in order to provide a robust thermal barrier.Heat leak through structural attachments may represent as much as half of the total energy absorbed by the storage volume in a typical application. The innovation of this proposal is the use of magnets, either rare earth, electromagnetic or diamagnetic, to essentially act as a spring to open a thermal isolation gap in either a strut or direct structural attachment between a cryogenic storage vessel and the bounding vehicle shroud or sun-shade. The gap may remain closed under the influence of gravity but open once on-orbit or in-space. Powerful Neodymium magnets with repulsion/pull forces exceeding 1000 lbs for 4"" diameter samples as well as recent developments in quantum levitation utilizing cryogenically cooled superconductors make a different type of isolation solution feasible, possibly with reduced launch mass or volume over existing strategies. Feasibility is based upon a significant reduction in heat leak (relative to conventional technologies) without a significant mass penalty. Current thermal isolation technology for on-orbit cryogenic storage is based primarily upon multi-layer surface insulation and low thermal conductance support straps. The proposed innovation addresses the shortcomings of current approaches by replacing low conductance straps/struts with a gap driven isolation scheme. Reducing or virtually eliminating the structural heat leak could have profound impacts for the scope and duration of future exploration and science missions. Ultra low thermal conductance cryogenic struts achieved through magnetic levitation could leverage MSFC involvement in any number of Dewar based science or cryogenic fuel depot projects. The objective of this activity is to develop a conceptual design of a magnetic levitation scheme to support and isolate a 2 meter diameter liquid hydrogen cryogenic propellant storage tank in a representative on-orbit or in-space environment. It is anticipated that a design study will advance the TRL 1 concept (i.e. never demonstrated) to TRL 2 with a strong basis for future advancement to TRL 3 or 4.

140,"Highly Vibrationally Excited OH in the Terrestrial Mesosphere: Key Rate Constants for OH(v = 9, 8) Removal by Atomic and Molecular Oxygen Required for TIMED/SABER Observations","SRI International proposes laboratory measurements of the rate constants for: 1) the total removal of OH(v = 9) and OH(v = 8) by O atoms and O2 molecules and 2) the single-quantum relaxation of OH(v = 9) to generate OH(v = 8) in collisions with O atoms and O2 molecules. The experiments will also determine the temperature dependence of these rate constants in the range 150-300 K, so that the rate constant data can be directly applicable to the mesospheric OH nightglow region. These measurements are critical for a reliable analysis of the OH(high v) Meinel band emission measurements of the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument aboard NASA’s Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite. Although the hydroxyl radical is a key player in the chemistry and energy balance of the middle terrestrial atmosphere and several studies have investigated energy transfer processes between OH(v) and atmospheric molecules, several gaps exist in our understanding of its interactions with oxygen atoms and molecules, the two most important atmospheric species responsible for OH(high v) collisional relaxation. None of the six aforementioned key rate constants has been measured at temperatures relevant to the mesosphere. Three of those rate constants have only been measured at room temperature and for the remaining three, i.e., the total removal rate constant for OH(v = 8) + O and the rate constants for OH(v = 9) + O2 and OH(v = 9) + O single-quantum relaxation to generate OH(v = 8), there have never been any laboratory measurements. We have developed laser-based experimental approaches to measure the vibrational level dependence of the collisional removal rate constants for collisions of OH(v) with atmospherically relevant colliders. Research in our laboratory has provided the first experimental measurements on the interaction of OH(v = 9) with O and N2 at room temperature. These experiments demonstrated that the total removal rate constant for OH(v = 9) + O at room temperature is significantly larger than those for removal by O2 and N2. A physical explanation of this rather unexpected result remained elusive for almost a decade. In a breakthrough development, our most recent studies provided the first laboratory demonstration of the existence of new rapid, multi-quantum vibrational-to-electronic relaxation pathways applicable to OH(high v) + O collisions. We plan to use a combination of laser-based experimental approaches we have previously developed in our laboratory to study the aforementioned critical six rate constants. SRI International is an ideally suitable setting to perform the proposed work given our history in the invention and design of experimental approaches to study these complex collisional energy transfer processes. Moreover, we will work with Dr. Martin Mlynczak, a member of the TIMED/SABER Team, who will oversee the implementation of our experimental results into the SABER data analysis and modeling. Accurate values of the deactivation rate of the high-v states of OH are necessary for proper interpretation of the SABER data from the TIMED satellite and their availability would be most beneficial as soon as practically possible given the advanced stage in the life cycle of NASA’s TIMED mission. In addition, these rate constant values are essential for computing the heating efficiency of the highly exothermic H + O3 reaction, a key factor included in photochemical models of the upper atmosphere. The proposed research fits well within the Laboratory Nuclear, Atomic and Plasma Physics (LNAPP) sub-element of the NASA Heliophysics Technology and Instrument Development for Science (H-TIDeS) Program because these results on photochemical kinetics and dynamics are needed in atmospheric models and address the goals of the Decadal Heliophysics Survey.

141,Frequency-agile and high-power terahertz laser local oscillators,"Many molecular species that comprise the interstellar medium have strong spectral features in the 2-5 THz range, and heterodyne spectroscopy is required to obtain ~km/s velocity resolution to resolve their complicated lineshapes and disentangle them from the background. Understanding the kinetics and energetics within the gas clouds of the interstellar medium is critical to understanding star formation processes, validate theories of galactic evolution, and to probe protoplanetary disks. The next frontier for heterodyne spectroscopy is the 2-6 THz region - a spectral range which is well matched to the use of terahertz quantum-cascade (QC) lasers as local oscillators (LOs). This proposal looks beyond the state-of-the-art, to the development of large format heterodyne arrays which contain on the order of 20-200 elements. LO powers on the order of 10-100 mW delivered in a high-quality Gaussian beam will be needed to pump the mixer array - not only because of the mixer power requirement, but to account for large losses in LO coupling and distribution. Large format heterodyne array instruments are attractive for a dramatic speedup of mapping of the interstellar medium, particularly on airborne platforms such as the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA), and on long duration balloon platforms where observation time is limited. In our recent work, we demonstrated a new architecture for terahertz quantum-cascade (QC) lasers capable of delivering scalable output power a near-diffraction limited output beam: the quantum-cascade vertical-external-cavity-surface-emitting-laser (QC-VECSEL). The enabling technology for this proposed laser is an amplifying metasurface reflectarray, which is made up of a sparse array of low-quality-factor antenna-coupled sub-cavities loaded with QC gain material. The sub-cavities on the metasurface radiate coherently into a high-quality-factor external cavity mode, which sets the beam shape and allows for scalable power combining. In previous work, we made two key proof-of-concept demonstrations: (a) a 3.4 THz QC-VECSEL which emitted continuous-wave power of 5 mW in a single-mode and in a high-quality beam at a temperature of 83 K with a wall plug efficiency of approximately 0.13%, and (b) the ability to continuously tune the frequency of QC-VECSEL by changing the cavity length, albeit with inconsistent beam pattern, power levels, and occasional multi-moding. Our overarching research goal in this successor proposal is demonstrate the QC-VECSEL as a credible frequency-agile local-oscillator. In the first theme, we propose to achieve 10x improvement in continuous-wave wall-plug efficiency from ~0.1% to 1% at 77 K, to allow generation of 10-100 mW with 1-10 W power dissipation at frequencies of 2.7 and 4.7 THz. In the second theme, we propose to demonstrate robust and repeatable tunability of a single mode over 15% of its center frequency near 2.7 THz while maintaining beam quality and power. In the third theme, we will demonstrate frequency-locking of the QC-VECSEL to a microwave reference over its tuning range, which is necessary to stabilize the LO output to resolve complicated lineshapes and allow long receiver integration times. This will be a critical demonstration, as the VECSEL cavity is very different than the monolithic THz QC-lasers that have been frequency/phase locked in the past. Furthermore, demonstration of this level of performance in terms of power, efficiency, beam quality, and tunability will be firsts for any type of stabilized THz QC-laser under consideration for a local oscillator, and would enable new possibilities for frequency-agile heterodyne instruments that could access multiple lines of interest. Additionally, in the course of the program, we will demonstrate the first QC-VECSELs at 4.7 THz which is close to the important OI line 4.745 THz (a major coolant for photo-dissociation regions in molecular clouds).

142,Low Power Broadband Low-Noise Amplifiers from 1-300GHz Project,"A few key technology areas are moving to the use of cryogenic detectors and require state-of-the-art cryogenic amplifiers. For example, nanowire sensors for optical communication ground stations achieve 30 psec timing resolution not available in other detector technologies. Focal planes for astrophysics are driving toward megapixel arrays to do both spectroscopy and multi-object observations of targets at high Z. These applications require a back-end amplifier with high bandwidth (1-10GHz). A number of low noise amplifier technologies exist at a variety of maturity levels and with a variety of strengths and limitations. The most mature amplifier technologies are semiconducting amplifier (InP HEMT or SiGe). The InP HEMTS have the lowest noise above several GHz, and are available commercially. However, more advanced InP HEMT ICs are only available to those with specialized knowledge and contacts with industry. By contrast the SiGe circuits have lower noise below two GHz and can be manufactured as complex mixed signal circuits integrating low-noise bipolar amplifiers with CMOS. Like InP, simple commercial SiGe amplifiers are readily available, but the more complex ICs requires a designer and the use of a commercial fabrication line. One benefit of this workshop will be introducing cryogenic technologists to these specialized designers of InP and SiGe ICs, in order to form new partnerships. Along with these semi-commercial technologies there are several new amplifier concepts still in the research phase including superconducting parametric amplifiers and RF/Microwave SQUID amplifiers. These amplifier technologies offer the possibility of quantum limited noise at frequencies as high as 300 GHz, but since they are research topics themselves they are not generally available. Again by bringing the researches working on these less developed technologies together with end-users we hope to create opportunities for collaboration. In general, the use of low-noise and quantum limited amplifiers can improve the sensitivity of many instruments and enable new ones. Some of these amplifier technologies are already being used in detector systems, but many are new or may be of benefit to additional NASA projects. This workshop will allow cryogenic instrument builders and amplifier experts learn about these technologies and find new opportunities for collaboration.

143,Neuromorphic Processors for Next Generation Systems,"In the latter half of the 20th century, microprocessors faithfully adhered to Moore’s law, the well-known formulation of exponentially improving performance. As Gordon Moore originally predicted in 1965, the density of transistors, clock speed, and power efficiency in microprocessors doubled approximately every 18 months for most of the past 60 years. Yet this trend began to languish over the last decade. A law known as Dennard scaling, which states that microprocessors would proportionally increase in performance while keeping their power consumption constant, has broken down since about 2006; the result has been a trade-off between speed and power efficiency. Although transistor densities have so far continued to grow exponentially, even that scaling will stagnate once device sizes reach their fundamental quantum limits in the next ten years. Due to this stagnation, processors, like those used for NASA’s navigation, communication, and telemetry systems, lack the scaling necessary to push space exploration further. A more energy efficient architecture/technology is required in order to increase the information bits per unit energy, and push processors architectures pass the thermal limits currently preventing increased speeds. Photonic integrated circuit (PIC) platforms provide a solution to this emerging challenge. PICs are becoming a key part of communication systems in data centers, where microelectronic compatibility and high-yield, low-cost manufacturing are crucial. Because of their integration, PICs can allow photonic processing at a scale impossible with discrete, bulky optical-fiber counterparts, and scalable, CMOS-compatible silicon-photonic systems are on the cusp of becoming a commercial reality. More specifically, Neuromorphic Photonics allow for the benefits of PICs to be merged with the benefits associated with non Von-Neumann processor architectures allowing for increases in both speed and energy efficiency.

144,Fundamental Performance Improvement of Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors for UVOIR Astrophysics,"Ultraviolet, Optical, and near-Infrared Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (UVOIR MKIDs) are one of the most powerful new technologies to emerge out of the NASA APRA detectors program in the last decade.  This proposal seeks to build on previous APRA grants to drastically improve the performance of UVOIR MKIDs.    Like an X-ray microcalorimeter ultraviolet, optical, and near-IR (UVOIR) MKIDs are cryogenic detectors capable of detecting single photons and measuring their energy without filters or gratings.  Our team has created this technology from the ground up, and fielded a 2024-pixel UVOIR MKID array on five separate observing runs at 5-m class telescopes.  With 34 observing nights successfully completed and two astronomy papers published using MKID data (the first astronomy papers published using MKID data at any wavelength), UVOIR MKIDs are at TRL 5-6 for ground-based astronomy, and TRL 3 for space-based astronomy.  The outstanding potential of these detectors was recognized in the recent NASA long term vision, “Enduring Quests, Daring Visions'', which recognized on page 88 that MKIDs have tremendous potential for future NASA UVOIR space missions, especially for finding Earth twins around nearby stars: “…microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs) would be a game-changing capability…''.  Current UVOIR MKIDs feature array sizes in the 10-30 kpix range, energy resolution R=16 at 254 nm, ~70% pixel yield, and quantum efficiency that goes from 70% in the UV to 25% in the near-IR.  These arrays, fabricated out of Titanium Nitride (TiN) on a high resistivity silicon substrate, are fully functional for ground-based science.   However, our current MKIDs are far away from their theoretical limits, especially in yield (70% vs. 100%) and energy resolution (R=10 vs. R=100 at 400 nm).  The yield is of especially urgent concern as missing pixels make accurate photometry difficult, especially for rapidly time variable sources like compact binaries that we have been studying.  The yield is low because the reactively sputtered TiN that we make our MKIDs from is extremely sensitive to deposition conditions, and the resistivity and hence resonant frequency of the MKIDs varies dramatically across a wafer, as shown in.  Our energy resolution is low because of a combination of factors related to the MKID material and the two level system (TLS) noise from our capacitors.  In order to improve our current energy resolution, yield, and quantum efficiency we need to move in new directions.  This proposal will focus on two main improvements: making better MKID resonator materials, and making lower noise capacitors.

145,Kerr-soliton On-chip Microcomb with Optimized Dispersion for Octave-spanning Output (KOMODO),"We are proposing Kerr-soliton On-chip Microcombs with Optimized Dispersion for Octave-spanning Output (KOMODO). The KOMODO platform will be a chip-scale optical frequency comb compatible with compact, deployable, next-generation optical atomic clocks and quantum sensors. Our proposed solution brings together engineered nano-scale waveguides, precision laser stabilization techniques, and advanced photonic packaging to realize true chip-integrated comb sources for demanding terrestrial and space-based applications in timing, spectroscopy, and quantum sensing. The project will translate directly into a commercial device that will provide a stabilized broadband frequency-comb output with low size, weight, and power (SWaP) requirements. Frequency combs are extremely stable multi-wavelength laser systems that provide a coherent link between the optical and microwave domains. Octave-spanning combs are essential for modern atomic timekeeping, where the comb is required to read out an optical atomic clock laser. The current state-of-the-art in compact frequency combs are fiber-based mode-locked lasers. While such systems have been instrumental in starting the transition of frequency combs outside of the laboratory, the SWaP requirements are still incompatible with many uses, especially space-based applications. In contrast, microcombs offer a path towards reducing the SWaP of these systems by an order of magnitude, opening possibilities for the integration of combs into hand-held devices and low-power spacecraft. The proposed KOMODO platform represents a new paradigm for fully stabilized microresonator frequency combs with low SWaP. We will achieve this by improving the TRL of four key technologies in this program: 1) turn-key comb generation with hybrid-integrated pump lasers, 2) advanced dispersion control through engineered photonic-crystal ring resonators, 3) self-referenced microcomb stabilization, and 4) environmentally robust photonic packaging.

146,Monolithic integration of high-efficiency III-nitride photocathodes and microchannel plates using a novel metallic contact,"Detection of light in the ultraviolet (UV) range (100nm to 400 nm) has a wide range of commercial, scientific and military applications, particularly in those areas where the UV component of light needs to be analyzed in the presence of a large amount of visible and/or infrared (IR) background light. High-performance photodetectors and imagers are essential parts of the enabling technology for future space-borne astronomy. Sensitivity, spatial and temporal resolution, photometric accuracy, and reliability of these photodetectors will be critical when defining, planning, and exploiting future space missions. In particular, for UV spectroscopy and low-light-level UV-imaging applications, there are strong demands for improved detectors which have higher quantum efficiency (QE), lower dark current, and more stable and robust operation. Highly robust, wide-bandgap gallium-nitride (GaN), and its alloys with aluminum and/or indium, are the most promising semiconductors for development of UV photodetectors for applications in space-based UV spectroscopy and imaging. In the Phase I program, Qrona Technologies, in collaboration with the space Science Laboratory at UC Berkeley, will develop and fabricate high-efficiency and high-resolution UV phototubes by depositing high-quality GaN-based photocathode structures directly on microchannel plates (MCPs), using a novel lattice-matched metallic buffer/contact layer. Monolithically integrated semiconductor photocathode/MCP detectors can achieve potentially much higher-performance than conventional phototubes in many applications, including higher detection efficiency, improved spatial and temporal resolutions, more immunity to magnetic fields, and better photoresponse uniformity on large format imagers, as well as reducing the device weight, size, complexity, and fabrication cost.

147,Superconducting Nonlinear Kinetic Inductance Devices,"Superconducting quantum interference devices, or SQUIDs, are by far the most sensitive magnetometers available, but two issues limit their commercial potential: their complicated and costly fabrication process and their unsuitability for large-scale array multiplexing. We propose developing a new kind of superconducting magnetometer, a superconducting kinetic inductance magnetometer (SKIM), that we evision will replace the SQUID due to its simple fabrication and its capability for high-density multiplexing, while matching the SQUID's exquisite sensitivity. A SQUID consists of a loop of superconducting material that is interrupted by Josephson junctions at two locations. A Josephson junction is a weak link between two superconducting regions, and can be realized by using an insulator, normal metal, or special geometry for the weak link. This makes the fabrication process relatively complicated, as multiple materials are required. The SKIM will consist of a single layer of superconducting material, so its fabrication will be very simple and much cheaper than that of SQUIDs. In addition, SQUIDs are difficult to multiplex on a large scale because each device requires ~6 connections, all of which must go into a cryostat where the device is kept. The SKIM, on the other hand, will benefit from an elegant multiplexing scheme in which all of the devices in an array can be read out simultaneously on a single line, using signal processing techniques. These advantages will prove to be important for many applications. SQUIDs currently have many applications that are of interest to NASA. They are routinely used for geomagnetic surveying, which would be applicable to NASA's planetary science missions. They are also useful for non-destructive evaulation (NDE), where they can detect hidden flaws in a material by measuring the magnetic field after the material is magnetized. This has been used for testing various airplane parts, and translates into an important safety procedure for NASA missions. They even have applications in medical imaging, where they are widely used for magnetoencephalography, a brain imaging technique. All of these cases would benefit from replacing SQUIDs with SKIMs. The SKIMs' simpler fabrication process would make them cheaper, and their high-density multiplexing capability would allow them to be used in large arrays, which could be used to measure large areas of magnetic field data at a time. This project will require a combination of analytics, simulation, fabrication, and experiment. First, analytical calculations and planar electromagnetic simulations will be employed to design the SKIM structure. Devices would be fabricated at NASA's JPL, so partnership with NASA will be essential for the project. Experiments would be done in a cryogenic testing setup. After demonstrating the performance of a single SKIM device, we will study arrays, with the goal of ~100 working devices. In addition to the extra fabrication and experimental considerations that must be dealt with for arrays, we will have to perform more analytics and simulations to deal with the issue of crosstalk between SKIMs.

148,Soft X-ray sCMOS Detectors for Space Exploration,"The discoveries made in astronomy and astrophysics rely on continued scientific advances in detector technology. Recent advancements like detecting gravitational waves and imaging distant galactic bodies in search of life have taken advantage of decades of progress in scientific instrumentation. To continue these advancements, the Astronomy and Astrophysics survey for the 2020's identifies the need for high resolution x-ray imaging and an increase in small scale missions to support long term scientific goals. The gap in the soft x-ray detector market place is difficult for smaller budget missions to manage as they must choose between cheaper sub-par detectors or those designed for class C and above missions, costing many millions of dollars each. By selecting commercially available sensors for this application, cost per detector decreases and smaller missions will be included in the rapid development cycle of terrestrial detectors that includes larger area arrays and smaller pixels. This will directly impact the size and cost requirements for small scale projects as focusing distance to obtain sub arcsecond resolution decreases. This proposal will leverage Sydor's commercial off the shelf scientific CMOS imager designed for soft x-rays, verify the space readiness, and design a camera system specifically targeted at class D space missions. The sensor used already has > 90% quantum efficiency at 100 - 1000 eV, can image at 48 Hz, and has 11 µm pixels, making it a good candidate for astrophysics applications. In collaboration with researchers at the MIT Kavli Institute polarimetry beamline, the Sydor sCMOS detector will be tested and wavelengths and under conditions relevant to NASA missions including thermal effects on noise, quantum efficiency, radiation damage, and vibration testing. At the completion of this work, a development plan will be in place to bring a low cost, flexible design soft x-ray detector to the astrophysics community in Phase II

149,Advanced SAPHIRA HgCdTe APD Arrays for NASA Space Lidar Applications,"In its 2017 Earth Science Decadal Survey report, the National Academy of Sciences recommended that NASA conduct missions to acquire data for nine Explorer- and Incubation-class observables. A next generation lidar system being developed at Goddard Space Flight Center, the Concurrent Artificially-intelligent Spectrometry and Adaptive Lidar System (CASALS), will be able to acquire data for five of these nine: terrestrial ecosystem structure, ice elevation, snow depth and water equivalent, surface topography and vegetation structure, and the surface-atmosphere boundary layer. The CASALS lidar will have a fast wavelength scanning transmitter which can position the laser beam at 960 footprint locations scanned across a 5.8 km wide swath. The 960 footprint locations on the ground will be mapped to an HgCdTe APD array detector in the lidar receiver. At any time, the lidar can arbitrarily point at tens to hundreds of the 960 possible footprint locations by wavelength tuning. At the receiver, to cover all 960 locations, a large linear detector array with close to 100% fill factor is required. We are demonstrating the scanning concept using a linear APD array developed by DRS in collaboration with Goddard. However, its small number of pixels (30 in the current device) and small fill factor (14%) are insufficient for full implementation of the wide-swath mapping. The detector capability is CASALS’s limiting performance factor. To overcome this limitation, we propose a planar linear array HgCdTe APD detector with 100% fill factor. This APD array will have a large array size (320 pixels), high APD gain (>300), high speed (~350MHz), low dark current (<1fA/pixel/rtHz) and high quantum efficiency (~70%). The final packaging of the device will have a matched transimpedance amplifier array, one per detector cell, inside the silicon fan-out underneath the HgCdTe APD chip. The amplifier will have bandwidth matching that of the HgCdTe APD with low noise (~1.5 pA/rtHz). The proposed device is based on the Leonardo SAPHIRA HgCdTe 320x256 planar APD imaging array developed for astronomy. Our initial test results under ESTO QRS-17 have demonstrated performance with very low dark currents, 1ns pulse response time and greater than 70% quantum efficiency in the near infrared spectral range. This detector will provide a significant performance advance for future NASA space lidar, including the CASALS 3D imaging lidar and CO2 and CH4 trace-gas lidar for Earth and planetary remote sensing, as well as hazard avoidance imaging lidar for NASA landers. We propose a three-year work program with the first two years concentrating on assessing, adapting and optimizing the Leonardo detector technology development. In Year 3, we will assess the performance of a delivered detector array at Goddard and demonstrate its performance with the CASALS instrument. Our entry TRL is estimated to be at 2 and we expect to exit at TRL 4.

150,PAH Infrared Spectroscopy in the JWST Era,"The extraordinary infrared instruments on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will transform the field of cosmic spectroscopy. We propose to supply the astronomical community with theoretical and experimental spectra of a wide range of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) and PAH clusters and to use our IR absorption spectra to calculate emission spectra that will be crucial in interpreting the new observational data.  The Infrared Space Observatory and Spitzer Space Telescopes have shown that the mid-IR emission spectrum of the interstellar medium is dominated by strong bands at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3 and 12.7 microns superimposed upon broad underlying plateaus generally attributed to PAHs, PAH clusters and very small grains. Despite the limited spectral and spatial resolution of these data, detailed analysis has revealed that each band is, in fact, a blend of multiple emission features. Subtle variations in the band blending can be detected even for spectra measured at different positions within a single astronomical source. These variations can be seen to arise from multiple PAH and PAH-related carriers that are each responding differently to the local physical conditions. The James Webb Space Telescope has near-IR and mid-IR instruments, NIRSpec and MIRI, with an extremely high spectral resolution, spatial resolution, and sensitivity that will revolutionize infrared astronomy. These instruments will provide spatial maps on a sub-arcsecond scale with an unprecedented level of spectral detail, allowing detailed study of the interrelationship of the individual components within each emission band. This will provide a critical insight into the molecular characteristics of the emitting species and their (photo)chemical evolution in space.  Exploitation of these astronomical spectra requires fundamental data on potential emitting species that fully account for all astrophysically relevant materials. Over the last two decades, spectra of neutral and charged PAHs have been calculated using quantum theory. Due to computational limitations, this data set is biased towards smaller or highly symmetric species. In addition, continued analysis of the mid-IR emission bands by several recent Spitzer studies, has demonstrated that PAHs and PAH clusters with less symmetric structures containing “bay regions” are more important for understanding the IR emission bands than had previously been realized. The currently available infrared data set on less symmetric PAHs and PAH clusters is insufficient to exploit the astronomical data.  Advances in computing power now allow spectra for a much wider range of species to be calculated. In support of the analysis of Spitzer data and the upcoming JWST mission, we therefore propose to calculate the 3-20 micron spectra of isolated as well as clustered neutral and charged PAHs containing up to 150 carbon atoms and with a wide range of compact structures and eroded structures with irregular shapes containing “bay regions”, “coves”, and “fjords”. These theoretical data will be validated by a dedicated laboratory study of PAH species and their clusters. These IR absorption spectra will be used to calculate emission spectra that can be directly compared to existing astronomical observations and that will be used to guide our quantum chemical and experimental studies on relevant species for support of Early Release Science proposals for JWST.

151,Cell Phone-based Lateral Flow Assay for Blood Biomarker Detection,"The ability to integrate a sensor platform with a cell phone for health monitoring and disease diagnosis for astronauts in space exploration has the potential to be cost effective and space saving. In this proposal, Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) will build upon expertise in lateral flow test strip (LFTS) assays by integrating an LFTS with a cell phone for the quantitative measurement of blood-based biomarkers. Our innovative and extremely cost-effective multi-analyte LFTS approach is imminently suited for space travel. All ""microfluidics"" (sample transport, reagent storage, mixing, etc.) take place via capillary action with no moving parts, no flow channels, and in a 5 mm x 5 mm x 30 mm space. Taking advantage of the built-in flash and high resolution camera, we will modify a commercially available cell phone with optical filters, lenses, a UV LED excitation source and a cassette holder for LFTS image capture. Quantum dots (QD) will be incorporated as labels with high quantum yield, resulting in higher sensitivity and narrow emission peaks in a multiplexed assay. In Phase I, we will develop and optimize a cell phone-based LFTS platform with the ability to quantitatively detect multiple biomarkers within clinically relevant ranges. The images of the LFTS will be captured on the cell phone and analyzed on a computer by the end of the Phase I. In Phase II, we will develop cell phone-based software for on-cell phone detection and data processing with expanded panels of biomarkers; advancing the TRL from 5 to 7.

152,High-Detectivity Type-II Superlattice Detectors for 6-14 um Infrared Applications,"SVT Associates proposes an novel type II superlattice structure to extend the cutoff wavelength and CBIRD SL photo diode structure with unipolar barriers to suppress dark current of SL detectors grown on GaSb substrate. This InAs/GaSb superlattice material system is capable of infrared detection in MWIR/LWIR spectral range, depending on layer thickness of each superlattice period. The goal of this program is to develop high performance type II SL based FPA for 6-14 um detection. Photo detector arrays using this material are of great interest to the NASA for various applications including, in particular, imaging and optical detection, and object discrimination when tracking targets in space or performing astronomical observations. These LWIR photo detectors can also find application to infrared-based chemical identification systems and terrestrial mapping. Applying the dark current suppression and cutoff wavelength extension process to the type II superlattice detectors should result in higher operating temperature, extended cutoff wavelength, and improved quantum efficiency, all important factors that should significantly enhance FPA operation. We intend to characterize the positive effects of proposed techniques in Phase I. In Phase II we will refine the techniques to realize passive-cooled high-performance LWIR FPAs with quantum efficiency larger than 50%.

153,Hydrogenation of Very Long Wavelength Infrared Focal Plane Arrays Based on Type II Superlattices,"We propose to advance the Ga-free InAs/InAsSb type II superlattice (T2SL) materials technology for very long wavelength infrared (VLWIR) focal plane arrays (FPAs) by passivating lifetime-limiting defects with hydrogen from inductively coupled plasma (ICP) H2-plasmas. In Phase II, 1k x 1k detector arrays will be fabricated and hybridized to matching read-out integrated circuits for implementation in future Earth and Planetary science infrared imaging instruments and become part of future space missions. Larger format FPAs (2k x 2k) will be realized as part of follow-up developments extending beyond Phase II. In Phase I, we will compute and optimize the electronic band structures, optical properties, Auger coefficients and ideal diffusion-limited dark currents of InAs/InAsSb T2SL absorber materials. The operating temperatures and overall thickness will be used as part of a trade-off study designed to achieve the quantum efficiency and dark current program goals. Shockley-Read-Hall minority carrier lifetimes of T2SLs are predicted to increase due to hydrogen-passivation, leading to larger signal-to-noise ratios for improved range of detection, enhanced discrimination capabilities, or operation at higher temperatures. Reducing the electrical activity of defects by passivating them with hydrogen is equivalent to lowering their density, and has proven successful in other semiconductor systems. The proposed hydrogenation technique makes use of the same dry-etch equipment employed during FPA manufacturing, making it easy to implement. In addition to the potential to remove the deleterious effects of bulk material defects, ICP hydrogenation also improves the detector's surface passivation quality. Smaller pixels, reduced integration times, and systems with larger fields-of-view will be realized, allowing the imaging of fast changing scenes over long ranges.

154,Bandstructure Engineered Type-II superlattice Antimonide Avalanche Photodiodes (BETA-APD) for Space Lidar Instruments,"The goal of this Advanced Component Technology (ACT) proposal is to develop next-generation detectors using emergent antimonide superlattice technology for space lidar instruments in support of ESTO’s mission of measuring natural earth phenomenon, crossing most of the Focus Areas outlined in the 2017 Decadal Survey. Primary applications will include swath mapping and vegetation profiles, but the detectors can be used for many other science applications, including atmospheric backscatter and absorption measurements. There is a need for new lidar detectors with high quantum efficiency, sensitivity and dynamic range. Recently, HgCdTe avalanche photodiode (APD) arrays have provided a major breakthrough in space and airborne lidar detectors with high quantum efficiency, low dark current, high multiplication gain and low excess noise factors. However, these detectors need to be cooled to low temperatures (~100K) because the dark current increases at higher temperatures and becomes unstable. Moreover, production of detectors based on II-VI alloys is hampered by low yield, limited fabrication of large format arrays, and high cost.   A team of scientists and engineers from academia (The Ohio State University/University of Illinois Chicago), small business (SK Infrared LLC), and a NASA center (Goddard Space Flight Center) propose to develop novel Bandstructure Engineered Type-II superlattice Antimonide (BETA) APDs using mature III-V semiconductor materials on InP substrates. The proposed approach will remove the need for cryogenic cooling and provide a manufacturable path using III-V compound semiconductor foundries. The project will combine robust theoretical and experimental research and development to demonstrate small format (4x4) linear-mode APD arrays with the goal of operating at T > 240 K with a 50% cut-off wavelength > 2.05 micron. This cut-off wavelength will support a variety of lidar systems based on fiber lasers operating at 1.03, 1.55, and 2 micron. The target specifications for the APD will be a high multiplication gain, low excess noise factor and low dark current density at the operating bias. The key innovation is to separately engineer the electron and hole impact ionization coefficients using strained layer superlattices and digital alloys of III-V quaternary semiconductors on InP substrates. The final deliverable will be a functioning small format array that is demonstrated at high operating temperatures and tested in a laboratory environment (TRL 4). The technical plan focuses on rapid iterations of modeling, material growth, device fabrication, and characterization of multiplier as well as separate absorption and charge multiplication candidates to demonstrate the desired performance goals. This technology can be rapidly transitioned to large format focal plane arrays beyond the scope of this ACT project to support the development of new lidar instruments with capabilities that greatly exceed the current state of the art. Therefore, the proposed technology will be disruptive because it enables operation close to room temperature, which will lead to a reduction in the size, weight, power consumption, risks, cost, and development time of future Earth remote sensing systems.

By working with Prof. Ding at Lehigh University, PI will explore fundamental limits to quantum efficiencies for up-conversion detection at 1.57 microns. She will implement, characterize, and optimize single up-conversion device capable of detecting 1.57 microns and 1.27 microns. She plans to achieve detections of CO2 and O2 using implemented up-conversion device. She will investigate fundamental limits to noises for up-conversion detections.

To achieve all these objectives, she has laid out a detailed work plan describing all the specific tasks necessary. Through optimizations, she will achieve the quantum efficiency of 50%, dark count rate of 50 Hz, bandwidth of GHz, electrical consumption of < 1 W, weight of < 1 lb, and dimension of 7x4x4 (all in inches).

158,"Characterizing a Polarization Detector for the Goddard Miniature Coronagraph
		
			(GMC)","The purpose of the project is to characterize an appropriate detector for the Goddard Miniature Coronagraph (GMC) that is of low risk, yet able to provide high temporal and spatial resolution for making temperature and flow-speed measurement in the solar corona. The detector being studied is a CCD camera with the capability to measure the polarized light of the corona. This will eliminate the need for the polarization wheel mechanism, which is typically used in traditional coronagraphs. Use of a polarization detector will reduce the mass and volume of GMC and lower the risk as well because one less mechanism will be employed. The characterization will involve observing the full moon and the 2016 total solar eclipse to optimize the exposure times of the coronal images taken using different filters.  Coronagraphs are the key heliophysics instruments that image the corona and traneint objects such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which  have wide ranging impact on the interplanetary spacecraft to geospace and life on Earth. Coronagraphs need to block the photospheric light of the Sun, so the corona (about a million times dimmer than the photosphere) can be imaged. Blocking the photospheric light is possible by an external occulting disk (occulter) in front of the objective lens of the solar telescope.  One of the constants problems in coronagraphs is the photospheric light diffracted by the external occulter that enters into the coronagraph system due to scattering by the optical elements.  By suitably designing the occulters and stops the intensity of diffracted and scattered light needs to be reduced. The optical design of traditional coronagraphs, developed by trial and error, has been driven by the level of diffracted stray light from the external occulter.  It is now possible to model the stray light using state-of-the art optical design software. Research at Goddard has demonstrated that it is possible to build a miniature coronagraph reducing the mass, volume, and cost by 50% compared to traditional coronagraphs without compromising on the performance. The challenge in such a miniature coronagraph is controlling stray light and diffraction using clever design of the occulter and the baffles. This project is aimed at further miniaturization of the Goddard Miniature Coronagraph by eliminating the polarization wheel mechanism with the use of a polarization camera. Traditional coronagraphs use a filter wheel and a polarization wheel mechanisms. By eliminating the polarization wheel, one of the mechanisms is eliminated and hence the risk is reduced. Furthermore, the mass of the instrument is also reduced. When a coronagraph is used for measuing the electron temperature and flow speed, one has to make images at four different filters. For each filter, the light intensity needs to be measured with three different polarization angles. For measuring the temperature and flow speed of the corona, the filter images need to be as close in time as possible. Using a polarization detector eliminates one of the mechanisms (polarization wheel) and allows us to do better science because images with various filters can be obtained much closer in time. For an exposure time of 10 sec, the polarization camera will cut down the sweep time by 30 sec. The core of the technology involves mounting a polarization strip to the front of the CCD and taking images that constain the polarization elements. Four neighboring pixels measure the polarized intensity at four different angles. Combining these pixels, one obtains the polarized signal that is needed for the scientific measurements. The quantum efficiency of most of the CCDs is low in the blue end. The filters to be used for scientific measurements are close to the blue range. The quantum efficiency of the best available CCDs range from 0.4 to 0.55. In order to obtain the optimal exposure times for the four filters, the full moon will be observed with polarization detector and the four filters mounted on a solar telescope.  The moon imaging will also validate the SNR performance of the instrument/camera.

159,Testing and Characterization of a Next-Generation Event Driven Hybrid CMOS X-ray Detector,"X-ray astronomy excels at observing some of the most energetic objects in the universe, such as supernovae and black hole accretion disks. These immense energies have adverse effects on the surrounding universe. Supernovae introduce pressure waves that are needed to form the next generation of stars in molecular clouds, while accretion disks give rise to powerful jets that allow observations of the universe as it existed billions of years ago.  Because the Earth's atmosphere is very effective at shielding us from cosmic x-rays, it is necessary to do our observing from orbit. By using charge coupled devices (CCDs), current X-ray space telescopes have provided insights into the universe, and have opened the doors for the next-generation of x-ray satellites. These future missions will have a greater throughput of incoming photons; surpassing the capabilities of the fastest CCDs. These missions will be observing gamma ray bursts to glean information about large-scale structure of space, and studying the environment around blazars and supermassive black holes, among other things. Current x-ray missions suffer from photon pileup when observing moderately bright sources, resulting in a loss of energy and flux information. This demonstrates a need for more advanced hardware in order investigate the universe around us.  The replacement for CCDs on future missions will come in the form of hybrid CMOS detectors (HCDs). HCDs offer many benefits over CCDs, and are already utilized in infrared and optical astronomy. Their foremost advantage is their ability to read individual pixels out as opposed to the “bucket-brigade” style associated with CCDs. This allows for low noise levels while maintaining a significantly faster readout rate that avoids pileup issues from high-intensity sources. Because of this novel readout style, HCDs are much more radiation hard than CCDs; resulting in a longer useful lifetime. Lastly, HCDs are more energy efficient and require an order of magnitude less power than current counterparts.  A new hybrid CMOS detector called the Speedster-EXD, produced by the x-ray instrumentation lab at Penn State, has been proven to offer all of these benefits. It is a 64x64 pixel detector that was done as a proof-of-concept to show that such technology is a realistic option in x-ray astronomy, and has made clear the techniques that will be employed as we move closer to a space-ready setup.  The next step in the development process is to move to a larger format array that will be an equivalent to what one might expect to find on a next-generation x-ray telescope. We are currently designing and building a comparable 550x550 pixel detector using the scaled up techniques learned from the prototype. My research will focus on calibrating and characterizing its performance.  Along with using standard techniques to model noise levels and gain variations, I will perform new and rigorous tests to describe the energy resolution, quantum efficiency, and effects of proton damage. These tests span an energy range of 0.5 to 14 keV through controlled exposures to a variety of x-ray sources. I will calculate the quantum efficiency by designing and building a unique test stand that is compatible with the new detector. By utilizing a well-characterized proportional counter, I will accurately determine the limits of detection for this new detector. It is also imperative to define how such detectors will fare in the high-energy proton winds found in outer space. Because charge is transferred through several centimeters of material in a CCD, charge-transfer abilities are hindered by proton damage. This reduces image quality due to degradation in the energy resolution. On an HCD the charge is transferred through a few hundred microns, so trauma is restricted to the local area. The use of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Labs will allow me to gather vital data on how these detectors will behave once in orbit.

160,"Passive Wireless Hydrogen Sensors Using Orthogonal Frequency Coded Acoustic Wave Devices, Phase II","This proposal describes the continued development of passive orthogonal frequency coded (OFC) surface acoustic wave (SAW) based hydrogen sensors for NASA application to distributed wireless hydrogen leak detection systems.  These novel sensors use an OFC SAW device structure, combined with Palladium (Pd) nanocluster film elements and hydrophobic self assembled monolayer (SAM) coatings to produce fast, reversible, highly sensitive hydrogen sensors capable of detecting a wide range of hydrogen concentrations at room temperature.  The technical feasibility of these sensors was clearly demonstrated in Phase I.  The Pd films experience conductivity changes due to the hydrogen induced stretching of the Pd nanoclusters and the quantum nature of conduction in nanocluster films.  The performance of the SAW device will change in response to a change in conductivity of this film.  Rapid (under 1 second) room temperature detection of hydrogen was observed, with complete reversibility of response.  Compatibility of film conductivity with acoustic wave propagation and detection of changes in film conductivity using variations on SAW device delay were confirmed.  Manufacturing compatible processes for SAM deposition and patterning were developed.  The successful elimination of the potential technical risks accomplished in this Phase I effort provides a sound basis for further development of these sensors.

161,Visible Blind SiC Array with Low Noise Readout,"We have designed and fabricated a Focal Plane Array (FPA) and low noise preamp board.  We wish to complete the development of the SiC array test assembly and perform full radiometric characterization including Quantum Efficiency (QE) and signal-to-noise performance in the spectral region VUV to 385 nm.       To date, we have (i) designed and fabricated both common cathode and common anode SiC detector arrays; (ii) designed and fabricated the detector packaging (FPA), and (iii) simulated, designed and fabricated a low-noise, compact pre-amplifier board. The FPA is mounted in the middle of the preamp board, to form the SiC array test assembly. The project will integrate the SiC array assembly and optimize it for noise performance.  We will then construct a UV test setup capable of going from VUV to 385 nm spectral wavelength region, to characterize the SiC array.  The characterization will include dark current, noise, relative response and QE. The data analysis results will be the final end product.

162,"Embedded TCP Agents for Near-Earth Communications, Phase I","Architecture Technology Corporation (ATC) will design, model, implement, and demonstrate extensible, embedded agents that will continuously adapt the behavior of the Internet-standard Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to the unique requirements of near-Earth space communications.  These embedded agents will enable TCP to adapt its behavior based on exogenous information, such as satellite ephemeris and ground station locations, or the current characteristics of the communications path as determined by lower-level protocols or periodic end-to-end tests.  By extending the transport protocol, this approach will improve near-Earth communications for all higher-level protocols that use TCP, such as FTP or HTTP, and will eliminate the need to modify these applications for space communications.  Initially, embedded TCP agents will enable TCP to maintain sessions, transparently to applications, across temporary losses of communications, such as when a satellite passes between ground stations.  Embedded agents can easily be extended to mitigate other effects of near-Earth communications, such as variable latencies or bit error rates.  While TCP has been widely researched, modeled, and extended, embedded TCP agents are unique in providing an extensible, production-quality platform for quickly integrating cutting-edge research results into products that will support the unique needs of near-Earth space communications and other demanding communications environments.

163,"A Miniaturized Adaptive Optic Device for Optical Telecommunications, Phase I","To advance the state-of-the-art uplink laser communication technology, new adaptive optic beam compensation techniques are needed for removing various time-varying atmospheric disturbances on an uplink laser beam.  The net effect of atmospheric wavefront turbulence produces degraded laser beam quality and limited data transfer rates and communication range.  Crystal Research, Inc. proposes to develop a new type miniaturized adaptive optic device that is capable of removing all significant atmospheric turbulence distortions.  The proposed device is based on electro-optic phase modulation in a single crystal substrate through electro-optic effect.  By avoiding actuator systems associated with moving mirrors, the proposed innovation not only significantly reduces cost, size, weight, and power consumption, but also greatly enhances the system performance and reliability.  The superior parameters of the proposed device could enable meeting the stated NASA mission goals of boosting data transfer rates in optical communication by a factor of 10-100 relative to the current state of the art. The new capabilities of the proposed adaptive optic device could lead to important advances in deep space and other optical communication systems.   In Phase I, we will fully exploit the advantages and feasibility of the proposed concept by demonstrating critical component technologies in laboratory breadboard experiments.

164,"Microfluidic Multichannel Flow Cytometer, Phase I","The proposed innovation is a ""Microfluidic Multichannel Flow Cytometer.""  Several novel concepts are integrated to produce the final design, which is compatible with on-orbit operation from the standpoint of gravity-independence, low mass, low power requirement and automated operation.

165,Terahertz heterodyne spectral imager of planets and comets,"Science goals and objectives. The objective of this proposal is the development of a sensitive, frequency-tunable heterodyne sensor for submillimeter/THz molecular line spectroscopy suitable for planetary missions. Such a device could be used for limb sounding the atmospheres of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Titan and Triton, observing water vapor plumes on Europa and volcanic plumes on Io, as well as performing spectroscopy of the tenuous atmospheres of icy moons (including Enceladus) and comets. The heterodyne capability allows very high spectral resolution spectroscopy to be carried out and thus individual spectral line shapes and Doppler velocities to be measured. The proposed Tunable Antenna-Coupled Intersubband Terahertz (TACIT) mixer will provide access to the 1-5 THz frequency range, which contains numerous strong spectral lines originating from the rotational transitions of many molecules, including H2O, CO, CO2, CH4, HCl, H2O2, CS, SO and HCN and their isotopologues. Future planetary missions that will benefit from this technology include the Uranus and Enceladus Flagship Orbiters and all New Frontier candidates identified in the current Vision and Voyages Decadal Survey other than the Venus in-situ mission. The TACIT mixer is expected to have 4 times the sensitivity than that of the state-of-the-art heterodyne sensor on MIRO/Rosetta. The mixer will be able to operate at 60-70 K (passive cooling in space) and will require just a few microwatts of local oscillator (LO) power. The outcome of this work will enable a multi-pixel heterodyne imager (16 pixels or more) which will allow the spatial mapping to be done 16 times faster than with a single pixel. The proposed R&D task will be a 3-year effort, which will build on the work performed under the previous 2014 PICASSO funding, during which we successfully demonstrated the operation of a single-pixel TACIT mixer at 2.5 THz. It will optimize the design of TACIT devices further, develop the technique for embedding such devices into THz waveguide which are required for achieving a multipixel imager, and conclude with a demonstration of a lab receiver consisting of a mixer, first-stage low-noise amplifier, and required optics. Methodology. The approach to the mixer is to explore a photoconductive mechanism due to the intersubband transition in a 40nm GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well (QW) heterostructure. The mixer device is fabricated from a pure material (electron mobility > 1E6 cm^2/V-s), in order to achieve the high sensitivity of the device resistance to temperature at 50-70 K. Using gate electrodes, the subband separation can be electrically tuned to any frequency in the 1-5 THz range. In order to be imbedded into a waveguide, the mixer QW structure is suspended on a thin Si membrane. The mixer bandwidth is set by the relaxation rate of the two-dimensional electron gas, which can be as large as 10 GHz. TACIT mixer devices fabricated on Si membrane will enable the waveguide-based mixer which will be the starting point for the follow-on 16-pixel imager development effort. Relevance to the call. The proposal is relevant to the 2018 PICASSO call, which supports the development of spacecraft-based instrument systems that show promise for use in future planetary missions. We will develop a new component (multipixel heterodyne sensor) that significantly improves submillimeter spectroscopic measurement capabilities for planetary science missions. The entry TRL for this technology is 3 and the exit TRL will be 4. Under this proposal, we will closely interact with an SBIR-funded effort to develop a novel quantum cascade laser THz LO source, which will be required to develop an imaging heterodyne array instrument we expect to pursue under the MatISSE program.

166,Swath Mapping Lidar with Fiber Lasers and PN Code Modulation,"We propose to develop a swath mapping lidar with a fiber laser operated from telecommunication industry and pseudo noise (PN) code modulation and correlation detection technique. We will use a recently developed 2x8 pixel HgCdTe avalanche photodiode (APD) array detector to achieve a near quantum limited receiver sensitivity and, thus the longest possible range. The proposed lidar is especially suitable to map small bodies, such as asteroids or comet cores where there is a greater uncertainty in their orbit and and shape. There can also be potential hazard objects near the asteroid. Investigations of asteroids including near Earth objects (NEOs) will provide us with greater insight into the solar system formation and evolution, the physical forces acting on the objects, and their orbit and potential encounters with Earth. Lidar measurements can determine the body's shape and orbit dynamics of the asteroid with high geodetic accuracy. A lidar investigation at asteroids can benefits from the versatility of the proposed lidar, which can operate in a long-distance survey mode, a precision global mapping mode, a high-resolution 3-D targeted area-mapping mode, and a real-time multi-pixel proximity ranging mode to assist landing and sample collection. Current planetary lidar cannot cover such a wide span of ranges. Additionally, conventional planetary lidar are usually too expensive to be considered for typical asteroid missions. We propose to demonstrate a low-cost multifunction lidar based on our patented return-to-zero pseudo-noise (RZPN) laser modulation and correlation detection technique. The receiver detects the laser pulse pattern instead of individual laser pulses by correlating the received signal with the original RZPN pattern. The technique has already been widely used in radio frequency (RF) ranging and the Global Position System (GPS). This approach enables the use of low peak-power lasers at high pulse rate for very long-distance range measurement without aliasing. The newly available HgCdTe APD array detectors give high quantum efficiency over a broad spectral range in the infrared which allows us to use existing fiber lasers from the terrestrial laser communication industries. The new HgCdTe APD array detector has single photon sensitivity which makes it possible to achieve a multi-pixel flash lidar type measurement from 10's to 100's of kilometer altitude orbits. The proposed lidar can be reconfigured in space. The individual pixel output from the multi-pixel detector can be combined to improve sensitivity. The receiver signal integration time can be continuously adjusted to allow a trade-off between the receiver sensitivity and the measurement rates for intermediate range measurements. The laser power can be continuously adjusted according to target distance. In addition to range measurements, the lidar can also measure the surface reflectance from the number of received photons and effectively image the asteroid with the laser illumination without the need for sunlight. For this MatISSE program, we plan to build a prototype instrument and perform environmental tests of the key subsystems. Our work will mature the instrument from TRL-4 to TRL-6 at the end of the program. The proposed lidar is directly relevant to the MatISSE program by providing a new instrument for near Earth object and asteroid studies called for by the recent Planetary Science Decadal Survey. Our approach provides multiple measurement capabilities with a single cost-effective instrument. It also provides a low-cost alternative to the existing planetary and landing lidar.

167,Design and Fabrication of Strain-Balanced nBn Dual-Band LWIR/LWIR Focal Plane Arrays Based on InAsSb/InAsType-II Superlattices,"The infrared spectral range is of particular interest for remote planetary sensing of gaseous molecules, such as H2O, CO2, CH4, N2O, CO, NH3, and many other compounds. Infrared thermography can also be used to accurate measure minute variations in surface temperatures. High performance infrared focal plane arrays (FPAs) allow rapid acquisition of a 2D surface maps--indispensable in planetary sciences. By using two different cut-off detectors integrated into a single FPA to simultaneously image a planet we can avoid atmospheric effect and much more accurately map minute variations in the surface temperature, or gain a clearer picture of the atmospheric composition. In recent years, Type-II InAs/GaSb superlattices have experienced significant development—we have played a pioneering role in the rapid development of that technology. However, the full potential of Type-II superlattice has not been fully explored and alternate superlattice architectures hold great promise; one of the most promising is gallium free InAsSb/InAs Type-II superlattices. In this project, we propose to study strain-balanced nBn InAs1-xSbx/InAs Type-II superlattice-based photodetectors and mini-arrays for LWIR/LWIR dual-band detection. Using this new superlattice structure, it is expected to achieve longer minority carrier lifetime. Longer minority carrier lifetime results in lower dark current, lower noise, higher operation temperature, and higher quantum efficiency. Applying this superlattice design to dual-band LWIR/LWIR FPAs, it is expected to achieve higher quantum efficiency, lower dark current, higher specific detectivity (D*) and reduced Noise Equivalent Temperature Difference (NETD). This work will form the basis of the Phase II work in which we will use this new superlattice structure to develop and deliver LWIR/LWIR dual-band FPAs for planetary sciences.

168,MgB2 Material Advancements Towards Innovative Astrophysics Technology-Development Phase,"Superconducting electronics has become an integral part of NASA's technology portfolio, especially for remote detection across the entire electromagnetic spectrum with unparalleled sensitivity. A particularly important application area includes direct and heterodyne detectors in the submillimeter (terahertz – THz) range for which the low value of the thermal energy in a sensor compared with the quantum energy is required. One major downside of superconducting detectors compared to other technologies is the need to operate at cryogenic temperatures (4 K or less). Significant effort was spent in trying to reproduce the state of the art detectors with the cuprate-based high-temperature superconductors (HTS), which could operate at or above 77 K. The success, however, has been very moderate given the difficulties in fabrication of the HTS compound. Besides, the thermal noise at 77 K is too high for most applications. It is recognized that superconducting materials with an intermediate critical temperature may be a better choice. In 2001, the material Magnesium Diboride (MgB2) was discovered to be superconducting with a transition temperature of 39 K, implying devices that can operate at a moderate 20-25 K. This is a very significant advantage to future NASA missions because there already exist high-heritage space cryocoolers that can achieve this temperature range at relatively low cost. This proposal will help NASA to integrate the new superconducting material into its facilities at Jet Propulsion Laboratory in order to develop better superconducting devices and detectors for future NASA missions. The proposal's key objective is to provide a practical source of thin films of superconducting MgB2. There are several applications of this material, which can ultimately help to realize Science Mission Directorate technological goals. MgB2 is poised to be the material of choice for detectors in many next generation THz heterodyne instruments. Some instrument concepts include GUSSTO (balloon-borne), SHASTA (for SOFIA-airborne), and a heterodyne instrument on Origins Space Telescope (OST-Spaceborne). A 20 K heterodyne instrument could also enable new concepts for smaller Explorer missions. Given the great scarcity of the academic and industrial labs where MgB2 can be synthesized, an internal source for such a material would be very important for NASA in order to take full advantage of its capabilities and associated benefits for future missions. During the concept phase, research was carried out to achieve MgB2 thin films by the Atomic Layer Deposition technique using an existing commercial system at JPL. The progress made is described in this proposal substantiating continued work in that direction. The ALD work had an ancillary result in finding suitable alternatives to a hazardous boron source. Additionally during the concept phase, significant advancements have been made externally on a more proven method of growing MgB2 thin films. The hybrid physical-chemical vapor deposition (HPCVD) process is a high temperature high-pressure process, producing the highest quality superconducting films worldwide. The two major drawbacks to this method are the small sample size and the use of highly hazardous Diborane gas. The development phase of this program would be used to design, procure and build a dedicated HPCVD system for large-area films to be grown at JPL using an alternative boron source, opening many doors to advance the state-of-the-art of superconducting electronics and detectors. The PI is Dr. Daniel Cunnane who has strong expertise in the growth of MgB2, particularly by the CVD technique and has matured multiple technologies using these films. He has successfully fabricated and characterized Josephson junctions, circuits, superconducting quantum interference devices, Josephson mixers, and THz hot electron bolometer detectors using these films.

169,"Novel Musculoskeletal Loading and Assessment System, Year 1","Functionally limiting decrements in musculoskeletal health and sensorimotor function are likely during exploration class missions given extended transit times and exploration vehicle mass and volume limitations for biomedical countermeasures. With 2016 IRD funding we developed and tested the novel musculoskeletal loading system (MLS, Fig 1). This innovative device optimizes resistance exercise training capabilities of pre-existing small exercise devices designed for exploration class missions. The 4 main objectives in the FY'17 effort include: 1) develop the ""SmartBar"" by improving the MLS bar electronics (i.e. installing IMU systems, load cells, and improved Bluetooth technology); 2) ruggedize the MLS and fabricate a telescoping bar; 3) add sensorimotor assessment/countermeasures capabilities using the WalkasinsTM system; 4) develop a novel data processing platform to integrate sensor, load, and positional data to assess sensorimotor function and provide a surrogate measure of ground reaction force. These updates will provide novel capabilities that are not currently available on ISS or planned for exploration class missions, and could provide superior protection and assessment capabilities for astronauts' musculoskeletal and sensorimotor health. Decrements in musculoskeletal health and sensorimotor function occur rapidly and cause severe performance decrements during and after spaceflight that will impact crews' ability to carry out mission critical tasks. There is not currently a single hardware device available to assess changes in or prevent losses in these physiological systems on ISS or one planned for exploration class missions. Our goal is to provide an integrated musculoskeletal and sensorimotor countermeasure and assessment tool to protect crew health and safety during exploration class missions. Our MLS team includes collaborators that have developed the ground based ""state of the art"" devices and knowledge in sensorimotor and exercise device testing and countermeasure development for clinical population and spaceflight, respectively. As a team of subject matter experts, we are developing a ""state of the art"" device for multi-physiological system protection during exposure to microgravity. This proposal strategically aligns with EMC and addresses HAT need 6.3.d-E, which calls out the need for development of small exercise equipment that can prevent musculoskeletal atrophy and assess musculoskeletal health during long-duration spaceflight; and HAT need 6.3.c-E, which calls for the ability to asses sensorimotor function and provide rehabilitation. The MLS innovation is a unique effort and not duplicative of other industry efforts. Testing and training sensorimotor function during exploration missions, without treadmill availability for ambulation, and within limited volume provides a very unique set of challenges that is not currently being explored by other efforts. Additionally the MLS ""SmartBar"" will provide the unique ability to assess exercise form, range of motion, and load without the added mass of force plates or requirement of a powered exercise device. A timely completion of this innovative effort will require parallel work efforts from collaborators in accomplishing the key objectives described in slide 1. Key milestones in this effort include 1) completion of the objectives detailed in slide 1; 2) engineering fit and function evaluations; 3) human in the loop testing, and 4) final presentation and closeout report. Key technical challenges in this effort include packaging the electronic bar assembly in a small space, developing the software interface to control the vibration sensors in the Walkasins system, integrating data from the ""SmartBar"" and the Walkasins system develop a novel data processing platform to assess sensorimotor function, exercise form, and provide a surrogate measure of ground reaction force. The product of this effort will be a novel light weight and compact MLS that attaches to a single-cable exercise device to allow full body loading and assessment of muscle strength and sensorimotor health in order to protect astronauts health during long duration exploration class missions. Our innovative device will protect the crew without significantly adding to the mass and volume of current small exercise device candidates for MPCV and exploration vehicles. Upon successful demonstration, the team will ensure integration of hardware and project outcomes with HRP's MPCV strategic plan. Further funding of this system for flight certification and an ISS technology demonstration will be requested from HRP in coordination with HRP's Advanced Exercise Concepts Project, which will initiate in 2016. Efforts related to MLS development and testing are planned beyond this funding effort. Study results and development efforts will be shared with multiple groups within NASA aimed at developing exploration exercise device concepts and physiological assessment and countermeasure tools. Upon completion of this years work the MLS ""SmartBar"" component will be further tested via use in the BAA Hab evaluations. The MLS will be tested in parabolic flight when flight opportunities become available. Development of the software interface to control the Walkasins will be implemented in future clinical trials as a part of advancement and FDA approval efforts of the Walkasins device. University of Houston collaborators intend to pursue this line of research via funding opportunities internal to UH. The different facets of the MLS lend well to technology maturation efforts for commercial, clinical, and spaceflight use. The combined ""SmartBar"" and Walkasins data provide a novel method to assess exercise form, load, and sensorimotor health in a single platform. Further development of this system will be needed to define thresholds or tests that could be used in clinical populations or in astronauts exposed to microgravity for long durations. Support in these research maturation efforts could enable MLS use in planned evaluations of exploration class exercise devices on ISS.

170,"Self-Assembly of Nanocomposite Nonlinear Optical Materials for Photonic Devices, Phase I","This program targets the development of new highly anisotropic nonlinear optical nanocomposite materials for NASA and non-NASA applications in advanced photonic and optoelectronic devices and optical integrated circuits.  Integration of electronic and optical components onto a single platform is becoming essential to advancing sensor, computational, memory, and communications technologies.  Designing optical and electronic materials from the molecular scale up is expected to result in a new era of  complex materials exhibiting enhanced optical properties, low processing costs, and substrate compatibility to enable device-on- a-chip technologies.  The nonlinear optical materials for development in this program will be composed of complex nanocomposite heterostructures produced by molecular self-assembly derived from a well-characterized family of quasi one-dimensional electronic materials with chemically tunable optical properties and dynamics.  These materials can be grown as single crystals or oriented thin films at low temperatures without epitaxial growth making their production low cost and platform-independent.  These materials have intimately coupled optical and electronic activity and are transparent over much of the electromagnetic spectrum making them well suited for optoelectronic devices.  The highly anisotropic and low-dimensional nature of these materials also provides highly oriented optoelectronic responses and quantum confinement effects that are desirable in advanced micro-optoelectronic devices.

171,A Photon Counting Imaging Detector for NASA Exoplanet Missions,"The key objective of the proposed project is to advance the maturity of a 256×256 pixel single-photon optical imaging detector. The detector has zero read noise and is resilient against the harsh effects of radiation in space. It will remove the transient effects of particle radiation from the science signal in real time and survive long-term exposure to high levels of radiation without deleterious effects on mission science return. We expect that the device will have state-of-the-art performance in other parameters, e.g., high quantum efficiency from UV to 1 m, low dark current, etc.  	We will extend proven techniques pioneered at Lincoln Laboratory to design and fabricate Geiger-Mode avalanche photodiode (GM-APD) array detectors based closely on devices recently made by the proposing team. Key innovations in the fabrication process make the devices easier to manufacture as compared to processes used in the past, and they produce an integrated focal-plane structure that is much more thermally and mechanically robust than previous generations of arrays. Once designed and fabricated, we will test the performance of the device in relevant environments that mimic operation in NASA space missions. At the conclusion of all activities, we will report to NASA on the suitability of this detector technology for NASA space missions.  	This detector will significantly extend NASA science capabilities for exoplanet, astrophysics, planetary, and earth sensing applications. It directly satisfies some of the highest priority technology development recommendations in recent NASA technology assessments.

172,"Optical Downconverting Nanomaterials for Enhanced Photovoltaic Efficiency, Phase I","For photovoltaic cells used to power space missions, such as those based on silicon, CuInGaSe2, and III-V materials, optical-to-electrical conversion efficiency is reduced by at least 25% because the energy of solar photons in excess of the band gap of the semiconductor absorber is lost. The excess photon energy is converted to heat. In addition, the quantum efficiencies of solar cells tend to degrade for high energy photons due to surface recombination effects. Optical down-conversion has been suggested as a method to recoup this lost energy, providing an increase in the theoretical single junction photovoltaic conversion efficiency from 30.9% to 39.6%. If substantial gains in PV efficiency could be achieved with a thin film coating of an efficient two photon downconverting layer, it would have a tremendous benefit not only to NASA payload burden, but also the the economics of terrestrial solar cells.  However, the absence of materials with suitable time constants for the relevant electronic processes has hindered the realization of this method. Our proposed solution, being developed by the University of Arizona, is to use the unique optical properties of nanocrystals to produce efficient downconverting emitter materials. Phase I will entail synthesis of the new materials at EIC Laboratories and their optical evaluation at Arizona, with a goal of demonstrating the first practical examples of such a thin film material.

173,"Passive Wireless Hydrogen Sensors Using Orthogonal Frequency Coded Acoustic Wave Devices, Phase I","This proposal describes the development of passive surface acoustic wave (SAW) based hydrogen sensors for NASA application to distributed wireless hydrogen leak detection systems.  Orthogonal Frequency Coded (OFC) SAW devices have been demonstrated as passive wireless temperature sensors in NASA Contract NNK04OA28C, and are being further developed under NNK05OB31C.  The proposed hydrogen sensors will use a novel OFC SAW device structure, combined with Palladium nanocluster film elements to produce fast, reversible, highly sensitive hydrogen sensors capable of detecting a wide range of hydrogen concentrations at room temperature.  The proposed research will utilize results from Argonne National Labs on the formation of Pd nanocluster films on self-assembled siloxane monolayers on glass.  These optimized nanocluster films demonstrated hydrogen sensing from 25 ppm to over 2% hydrogen, with response times of milliseconds, complete reversibility, and no baseline drift at room temperature.  The films experience large conductivity changes due to the hydrogen induced lattice expansion of the Pd nanoclusters and the quantum nature of conduction in nanocluster films.  The performance of the SAW device will change in response to a change in conductivity of this film.  Issues including SAM formation on piezoelectric substrates, nanocluster film deposition, and simulation of device performance will be evaluated.

174,An Implant-Passivated Blocked Impurity Band Germanium Detector for the Far Infrared,"We propose to investigate the feasibility of fabricating a germanium blocked-impurity-band (BIB) detector using a novel process which will enable us to: 1- fabricate a suitably-doped active layer using the well-established bulk crystal-growth process, which guarantees excellent dopant control and extremely low compensating impurities, and 2- grow the blocking layer using an implant-passivation technique which will produce the required high purity and a very sharp transition from the active to blocking layer. These features are key in design and optimization of multi-layered structure of BIBs, and their implementation and quality are crucial in optimum operation of these detectors. The proposed process is a drastic departure from conventional epitaxial methods, such as chemical vapor deposition and liquid phase epitaxy, which have yet to produce far IR BIBs suitable for astronomical instruments. Germanium BIBs will offer extended wavelength response to at least 200µm, high quantum efficiency, high immunity to ionizing radiation, and elimination of long-term transient and memory effects. Coupled with their compatibility with Si cryo-CMOS readout multiplexers and the planar, bump-bond hybridization process, these detectors will make possible the construction of large format, high sensitivity FPAs for far IR astronomy and will replace the current unstressed and stressed germanium detectors.

175,Barrier Infrared Detector (BIRD),"A recent breakthrough in MWIR detector design, has resulted in a high operating temperature (HOT) barrier infrared detector (BIRD) that is capable of spectral coverage of not only the entire MWIR atmospheric transmission window (3 – 5 μm), but also the short-wave infrared (SWIR; 1.4 – 3 μm), the near infrared (NIR; 0.75 – 1.4 μm) and the visible bands. While other advanced MWIR detector designs have been able to achieve high temperature operation with 4 μm cutoff wavelength, the JPL invention is unique in that its spectral coverage includes the entire MWIR atmospheric transmission window. JPL will design, fabricate, and fully characterize a 640x512 format HOT-BIRD FPA with increased quantum efficiency and extended spectral coverage. Unlike the small format experimental FPA, the proposed FPA will undergo a substrate removal process which extends the cut-on wavelength into the visible range, as well as paving the way towards very large-format (multi-megapixel) arrays. One advantage of the extended spectral coverage FPA is that it eliminates the need for multiple infrared planes; a single optical train can be used to cover the visible to MWIR spectral bands on imagers, spectrometers, spectral- imagers, and hyper-spectral imagers. The other key advantage is the higher operating temperature, which enables passively cooled operations from low earth orbit (LEO), eliminating the need for active coolers. Passive cooled systems use no moving parts, have no vibrations, and provide better reliability. These advantages lead to a reduction in instrument size, mass, mechanical complexity, optical complexity (i.e., no beam splitters, prisms, etc.) and power requirements.

Our amplifiers are designed to have greatly improved gain characteristics over similar experimental devices.   The amplifiers would enable revolutionary astrophysics instruments with far-infrared photon-counting detectors or high-resolution x-ray microcalorimeters. Our goal is to build microwave amplifiers with near quantum-limited sensitivity, octave or greater bandwidth, gain > 20 dB for signals of frequency 1 – 10 GHz, and power dissipation less than 1 microwatt at a 100 mK operating temperature, or 1 milliwatt at 4 K. Such amplifiers would find immediate application in efforts to develop far infrared instruments based on Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs), or in x-ray microcalorimeters with microwave SQUID amplifier (mSQUID) readout systems.Existing state-of-the-art broadband HEMT amplifiers used so far for MKID or mSQUID readout have noise temperatures about 1 – 10 K. The noise of HEMTs, while low enough for many applications, limits sensitivity of MKIDs. In addition, the power dissipation of cryogenic HEMTs is not as low as desired in a space-based instrument. The new amplifiers in this project would be of great benefit in high performance instrument concepts involving MKID or mSQUID arrays for astrophysics missions.

177,An Implant-Passivated Blocked Impurity Band Germanium Detector for the Far Infrared,"We propose to fabricate a germanium blocked-impurity-band (BIB) detector using a novel process which will enable us to: 1- fabricate a suitably-doped active layer using the well-established bulk crystal-growth process, which guarantees excellent dopant control and extremely low compensating impurities, and 2- grow the blocking layer using an implant-passivation technique which will produce the required high purity and a very sharp transition from the active to blocking layer. These features are key in design and optimization of the multi-layered structure of BIBs, and their implementation and quality are crucial in optimum operation of these detectors. The proposed process is a drastic departure from conventional epitaxial methods, such as chemical vapor deposition and liquid phase epitaxy, which have yet to produce far IR BIBs suitable for astronomical instruments. Germanium BIBs will offer extended wavelength response up to at least 200µm, high quantum efficiency, high immunity to ionizing radiation, and elimination of long-term transient and memory effects. Coupled with their compatibility with Si cryo-CMOS readout multiplexers and the planar, bump-bond hybridization process, these detectors will make possible the construction of large format, high sensitivity FPAs for far IR astronomy and will replace the current unstressed and stressed germanium detectors.

178,Ghost Imaging of Space Objects,"Ghost imaging is an optical imaging technique that utilizes the correlations between optical fields in two channels. One of the channels contains the object, however lacks any spatial resolution. In the other, empty channel a space-resolving optical detection is allowed. The image is reconstructed by correlating the signals from two channels. In the original implementation, the channels had to be coupled to quantum-correlated (entangled) optical fields. Later it was shown that this approach could also work with ordinary thermal light (e.g., star light), which also possesses correlation properties. However the ghost imaging geometry remains poorly compatible with the imaging of astronomical objects. Specifically, creating the correlated optical channels requires a beam splitter to be placed between the source and the object. The study team recently re-examined this requirement and found a possibility to avoid it, therefore potentially opening the doors to the ghost-imaging of distant objects using natural light. The key to the proposed approach is the understanding that an optical mode can be coupled in two channels not only by splitting its amplitude with a beam splitter, but also by sub-mode detection, which occurs naturally when the object is smaller than the transverse coherence length. In Phase-I the team will discuss the requirements arising for this type of ghost imaging and theoretically validate the novel approach.

179,Diamond Electron-Spin Clocks For Space Navigation and Communication,"Precision clocks are needed in a broad range of applications, including satellite communication, high-bandwidth wireless communication, computing systems, and navigation, such as the global positioning system (GPS). The most accurate time and frequency standards developed to date are atomic clocks, which derive their stability from electronic transitions in atoms. But atomic clocks, which rely on atomic gases or trapped ions and atoms, are large and difficult to assemble and control. By contrast, a solid-state alternative leveraging modern semiconductor technology would be ideal for integration in a range of devices, may be orders of magnitude smaller, lighter, and be more durable in a range of potentially harsh environments. The material hardness, rigidity, and compactness of the proposed solid-state atomic clock analog makes it ideal for space applications. In particular, in this program, we propose to develop a solid-state alternative to atomic clocks, implementing our recent theoretical proposal for frequency locking to magnetic sub-levels of the nitrogen vacancy (NV) color center in diamond. Due to the NVs exceptionally long spin coherence time, a high density of spins in the solid, and optical spin detection, we estimate a time stability that rivals or exceeds the performance of the newest chip-scale Cs and Rb standards, but in a package that is at least 2 orders of magnitude smaller and lighter. Developing an atom-like standard in a solid state host promises rapid integration into semi-conductor fabrication processes, thus achieving a technological breakthrough in portable standards. The goal of the proposed program is to (i) develop a diamond-based, 2.87-GHz CMOS-integrated clock employing electronic transitions in ensembles of the diamond NV center, and to reach an Allan deviation better than 10^12/(integration_time)^1/2, matching or exceeding the performance of compact atomic clocks; and (ii) to establish a full quantum-theoretic understanding of spin-based frequency and time standards based on color centers in diamond, promising advanced spin clock protocols. Solid-state implementations of high- performance atomic gyroscopes and atomic magnetic gradiometers will be investigated. This solid-state alternative to atomic clocks could benefit a range of NASA capabilities: smaller, lower-power clocks in satellites; uninterruptable/jam-tolerant GPS navigation; compact satellites; formation flying; deep-space space-craft; and micro-satellites. The program would also advance our theoretical understanding of possible high-performance gyroscopes for navigation and magnetic gradiometers for magnetic imaging at security checks or in the field.

180,"Productive Large Scale Personal Computing: Fast Multipole Methods on GPU/CPU Systems, Phase I","To be used naturally in design optimization, parametric study and achieve quick total time-to-solution, simulation must naturally and personally be available to the scientist/engineer, as easily as email or word-processing. Environments such as Matlab/IDL allow ease of use, but unless simulations are extremely fast, they cannot be used naturally.  Many large-scale numerical calculations require storage and computation that grow as the square/cube of the number of variables, including such linear algebra operations as solving dense linear systems, computing eigen-values/vectors, and others. The use of fast algorithms such as the fast multipole method (FMM) coupled with iterative methods allows many problems of interest to be solved in near linear time and memory. We have taken a leadership role in applying and extending the FMM to various problems in acoustics, fluid flow, electromagnetics, function fitting and machine learning. Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) are now ubiquitous in game consoles, in workstations and other devices and are special purpose processors for graphics, that are predicted to shortly achieve performance in the hundreds of gigaflop range for specialized calculations (much faster than COTS PCs) at low price points. It is conceivable now to equip personal workstations with several CPUs and GPUs, and solve problems with millions or billions of variables quickly using fast algorithms. We will take an important algorithm with wide applicability: the FMM, and implement it on the widely available heterogeneous CPU/GPU architecture, and prove the feasibility of accelerating it tremendously. A fundamental reconsideration of the algorithm that maps appropriate pieces on to the correct part of the architecture forms the basis of our approach. Developed software will be tested, and benchmark problems solved. A library of software that will support the porting of the FMM and other scientific computing to the CPU/GPU architecture will be developed.

181,"High Performance Avalanche Photodiodes for Photon Counting at 1064 nm, Phase I","The need for higher performance fiber optic telecommunications receivers has provided the impetus for substantial progress during the last decade in the understanding and performance of InP-based linear mode avalanche photodiodes (APDs) for the wavelength range from 1.0 to 1.7 um.  However, these advances have not been paralleled in the performance and availability of single photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) based on similar design and materials platforms.  Moreover, the vast majority of the activity in this field has been focused on optimizing devices for telecommunications wavelengths in the vicinity of 1550 nm, and there has been very little work on devices for use at 1064 nm.  For this SBIR program, we propose to apply innovative design concepts for the development of high performance SPADs optimized for 1064 nm applications.  In particular, we will implement a novel bandgap engineering approach to tailor the SPAD avalanche gain properties to realize higher single photon detection efficiency while maintaining the very low dark count rates that are made possible by optimizing the absorption region design for the detection of 1064 nm photons.  We will also apply design concepts that we have innovated during the course of developing state-of-the-art 1550 nm SPADs that involve optimization of the device electric profile for photon counting as well as epitaxial layer compositions.  These efforts will culminate in 1064 nm large area detectors (with active area diameters up to 500 um) that demonstrate feasibility in meeting SPAD performance targets including 50% detection efficiency, bandwidth of 500 MHz, saturation levels of 50 Mcounts/s, and non-gated operation.

182,Cold Atom Laser Module (CALM),"Atom-optical inertial sensors and atomic clocks have demonstrated superior performance owing to the intrinsic stability of atomic systems. Central to making cold-atom sensors practical is their ability to reliably operate for extended periods without user intervention. The current generation of laser diodes, which are at the heart of atomic sensors, suffer from power degradation and mode hops on timescales incompatible with long-term deployment. Because these properties are inherent to the diodes, it is prudent to circumvent these problems with diagnostic protocols aimed at early detection and action, enabling a wavelength-agnostic technique to deliver reliable, long-lived laser sources at wavelengths relevant to atomic sensors. Development of the CALM laser module, in tandem with validation of its components under ionizing radiation, will result in a ruggedized and reliable laser source capable of autonomously driving an atom-based sensor within the space environment. Such an effort would enable space-based applications for atomic sensors such as IMUs, clocks, and magnetometers, opening up significant market opportunities in the defense and commercial sectors. At the conclusion of the program, AOSense will deliver a space-compatible laser system with a 10 year lifetime capable of operating a single-axis atomic inertial sensor or clock. Our Phase II-E effort will adapt the CALM Phase II design to 852 nm for integration in NASA’s Atom Interferometer Gravity Gradiometer (AIGG).

183,"Modulating Retro-Reflectors: High-speed Asymmetric Laser Communications with Low-Fidelity Pointing Requirements (Phase II): Testing and Risk Reduction, Year 2","This is the second phase of a project that aims to advance a novel optical communication technology for spacecraft based on modulating retro-reflectors. Modulating retro-reflectors (MRR) are a potential communication alternative for small spacecraft. Retro-reflectors directly reflect a laser beam back to its source, regardless of its orientation. Using additional semiconductor technology, the return signal can be modulated, adding data transfer capability to the retro-reflector. A ground station would send up a laser beam to the spacecraft, and would receive high-speed data through the modulated return beam. The benefit of the system is that it utilizes the advantages of optical communication without imposing advanced attitude control requirements onto the spacecraft. The first phase of this project investigated the requirements for MRR communication on small spacecraft and tested capabilities of different MRR prototypes. In the second phase, we aim to make a selection of a protype technology and design, built and test an electrical circuit board that would enable usage of the device in a small spacecraft. Outcomes: We selected a Multiple Quantum Well (MQW) MRR for our prototype design. We developed, tested and documented a printed circuit board to integrate that MQW MRR into a cubesat. The circuit board follows the specication of NASA Ames PhoneSat bus to allow easy integration in to future cubesat missions for a technology demonstration. Interface control documentation is available on request.

184,"Low Phase Noise Universal Microwave Oscillator for Analog and Digital Devices, Phase I","An inherently rugged Universal Oscillator (UO) is needed to enable a superior class of configurable communications for NASA applications. The requirements are a low phase noise RF output concurrently with a rugged, reliable, small, power efficient, and frequency tuning ability. VIDA Products has developed technology that will ultimately enable an integrated circuit YIG oscillator with high Q resonators and low power consumption that fills these requirements. The high Q YIG resonators are made possible by quantum electron spin precession and are essentially lossless. In general, a resonator is realized by a YIG sphere RF magnetic fields coupling to the oscillator circuit structure.  A bias magnetic field on the spheres at a right angle to the coupling field vector sets the frequency of operation. It is a linear function of exactly 2.8 MHz per Gauss. Its equivalent electrical circuit is composed of circuit elements unrealizable by finite components that vary over frequency so the filter bandwidth does not change with tuned frequency. Thus the Q increases with frequency since a definition of Q is the tuned frequency divided by the bandwidth. For oscillators using these resonators the phase noise is excellent and continues to perform as the oscillation frequency increases. The Resonant Ring Oscillator topology is easily realizable using MMIC technology to reduce a YIG based oscillator to a single IC with the ability to produce external fields of the correct vectors and path losses.  To make use of this phenomenon, a proprietary circuit utilizing leakage shielding and frequency locking will control the magnetic bias field and be integrated in the UO IC. The result will be a Universal Oscillator that can be produced to operate at any frequency between 3 and 30 GHz at cost equivalent to current VCO technology but with 30 to 40 dBc improvement in phase noise performance. Completing the development of this technology now will save immeasurable resources.

185,Technology Development for an AC-Multiplexed Calorimeter for ATHENA,"With the recent choice of ""The Hot and Energetic Universe"" as the theme for the European L2 large mission slot, the ATHENA mission concept is very likely to be chosen for the 2028 launch opportunity. ATHENA will include a high-resolution, imaging spectrometer consisting of a large array of transition-edge sensor (TES) X-ray microcalorimeters. Presently, the U.S. has an active and successful program developing TES calorimeters read out with Time- and Code-domain multiplexing (CDM). In contrast, ESA has invested significantly in frequency-domain multiplexing schemes for TES sensors. Frequency-domain multiplexing requires that the sensors receive an Alternating Current (AC) bias and, so far, AC bias has degraded the energy resolution of X-ray TES sensors by ~50% so that the missions specifications for ATHENA have not yet been met under AC bias. Nonetheless, frequency-domain multiplexing with AC biased sensors may be the baseline plan for ATHENA so there is a clear need for further technology development in this area. To address this need, we propose to improve the performance of small numbers of X-ray TES sensors (one or two) under AC bias in order to meet the mission specifications of ATHENA. We will also design and build Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) amplifiers optimized for the read out of many AC biased sensors. Together, these results will boost the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of AC biased X-ray calorimeters from 3 to 4. These results will significantly strengthen the ability of the U.S. to participate in the planning process for ATHENA and to contribute X-ray calorimeters, SQUID amplifiers, and other components to the spectrometer instrument.

186,Modeling of Complex Material Systems in Extreme Environments for Space Technology,"Among the many enabling technologies of space research is the design of materials which are stable in the environments of interest for a given application. At the cutting edge of material design are complex materials: hybrids, composites, and alloys whose constituents and processing details can lead to a wide range of properties. The design of a complex material can be focused towards specific or multiple applications, and tailored to meet the requirements of a given mission. Hybrid materials are defined by two distinct constituents mixed at the molecular level, usually an inorganic phase intermixed with large organic molecules. The field of nanocomposites intersects somewhat with the field of hybrid materials, though composite materials are typically distinguished by larger spatial separation between constituents. Complex materials may offer the properties of two different materials in parallel, with additional effects due to chemical interactions. Furthermore, alloys and hybrids can form the constituents of advanced composites. The possibilities are extremely numerous in designing complex materials, to the extent that experimental trial and error becomes impractical and costly. We propose that material simulation techniques may have much to offer in the design of complex materials, from high-throughput material selection to detailed observation of chemical processes in a given environment. Here, we focus on the development of atomistic (atom-by-atom) models for complex materials in extreme environments. Empirical models, in which atoms are assumed to exhibit parameterized interatomic potentials, often lack the transferability necessary to explore extreme environments. This is because they are typically fit to a set of properties which may or may not be reliable outside of the range of fitting. For this reason, it is important to employ quantum mechanical methods as closely as possible. However, complex material systems naturally require a large number of atoms to construct a representative unit, presenting a problem for quantum methods in which computation time scales at best quadratically with system size. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have become widely utilized in material simulations because of their remarkable ability to reproduce measured quantities. DFT calculations are limited to a few hundred atoms on a high-performance system. This may be enough to study the ground state properties of complex material systems, but DFT is known to misrepresent certain interactions that are likely relevant to the problem of complex materials design, such as van der Waals (vdW) bonding. Empirical extensions to DFT are commonly employed to achieve resolution of such misrepresented effects. Examples include empirical corrections to quantum models and/or application of known macroscopic properties to shrink the representative unit for atomistic calculations. Such approximations will certainly be necessary to approach the problem of modeling complex materials, especially in consideration of time-dependent processes in extreme environments. We consider one important application in space technology: design of hybrid materials for thermally protective ablators during atmospheric entry. Engineered hybrid materials are attractive for this application, as there will be a very specific set of requirements for a given ascent. Mechanical stability and precisely tuned ablation characteristics are desirable, and there is potential to engineer enhanced optical properties (at atomic as well as photonic scales) to reduce radiative heating. The actual thermal, mechanical, and optical design goals will vary depending on the atmosphere and vehicle of interest. A computational model could be used first to select candidate materials for a given application, then to isolate and tune the relevant degrees of freedom for the intended purpose, and finally to expand the scale to an actual device and inexpensively test the design.

187,"Ultra-Compact Optical Spectrometer for Organic Mapping, uCOSOM (microcosm)","We propose to develop a soda-can-size, 500 g, 400 mW instrument for mounting on small lander or rover arms: the ultra-Compact Optical Spectrometer for Organic Mapping (uCOSOM) instrument. Two core technologies enable the proposed instrument: a narrow linewidth deep UV laser and a new uncooled, resistive gate linear DUV CCD array detector with high quantum efficiency in the DUV with fast read rates and low read noise. The need for in situ micro-scale mapping for trace concentrations of organics on planetary surfaces is exemplified by requirements put forth the (July 09) Mid Range Rover; Science Analysis Group (MRR-SAG) and again in a 2010 Astrobiology paper by Pratt et al. uCOSOM fulfills similar organic needs on future in-situ missions with MER class rover/arm sizes or small landers to planetary bodies such as Mars, icy worlds (Titan, Europa, Enceladus), and small primitive bodies. uCOSOM provides a broad organic and inorganic compound measurement capability without the need for sample handling or reagents. It will excite sub-ppb levels of organic compounds on rocks, soil, or other surfaces in the deep UV below 250 nm and simultaneously measure Raman scattering in the 250 nm to 260 nm region (1000 to 4000 cm-1) and native fluorescence in the 260 nm to 700 nm region at a working distance of several cm, with long depth of focus, and with the ability to map areas up to 1 by 1 cm in size with 100 micrometer spatial resolution. The pulsed source enables solar blind gated Raman and fluorescence spectral measurements but also fluorescence and phosphorescence decay measurements to provide orthogonal information about target composition. The instrument can also provide spectral reflectance of targets from 250 nm to 700 nm together with Raman and fluorescence data, using solar illumination, and enable solar and stellar irradiance and sky background measurements.

188,High Efficiency 4 K Cryocooler for Space Missions,"Future astrophysics missions require efficient, low-temperature cryocoolers to cool advanced instruments or serve as the upper-stage cooler for sub-Kelvin refrigerators. Potential astrophysics missions include Lynx, the Origins Space Telescope, and the Superconducting Gravity Gradiometer. Cooling loads for these missions are up to 300 mW at temperatures of 4 to 10 K, with additional loads at higher temperatures for other subsystems. Due to low jitter requirements, a cryocooler with very low vibration is needed for many missions. In addition, a multi-stage cooler, capable of providing refrigeration at more than one temperature simultaneously, can provide the greatest system efficiency with the lowest mass. Turbo-Brayton cryocoolers have space heritage and are ideal for these missions due to negligible vibration emittance and high efficiency at low temperatures. The primary limitation in implementing Brayton cryocoolers at temperatures below 10 K has been the development of high efficiency turbines. On the proposed program, Creare plans to leverage recent developments in gas bearing technology and low-temperature alternators to realize a high-efficiency, low-temperature turbine. On the Phase I project, we successfully performed a proof-of-concept demonstration of the turbine technology. On the Phase II project, we will build and demonstrate an advanced low-temperature turbine at temperatures of 4 to 10 K.

189,Expedient Formulator for Generative Evaluation (XFORGE),"Expedient Formulator for Generative Evaluation (XFORGE) is a framework that transforms Guidance, Navigation and Control (GNC) calculations into formulations that have the advantages of speed, numerical accuracy, and computational stability. XFORGE enables significant Size, Weight and Power, Cost, and Performance (SwaP-CP) improvements over current state-of-the-art Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) GNC calculations by generating equivalent formulations that have no numerical errors or instabilities. Within XFORGE, these formulations can be implemented in flight-like hardware and assessed so that implementations that require excessive computer resources, are too sensitive to environmental factors, are susceptible to Cyber-attack etc., are eliminated. Finally, fault tolerance technology is applied across the formulations to provide an expedient, stable, robust implementation of required GNC calculations. XFORGE differs from COTS GNC calculations which use standard primitives (e.g. square root, sine, exponential) to implement trigonometric and algebraic equations. These standard primitives use iterative algorithms that loop through successively better estimates until the required accuracy is obtained (e.g. the “Newton-Raphson Method”). This method is fragile to implementation methodologies such as mixing single precision and double precision variables within the same calculation. Also, the amount of time needed to complete COTS GNC calculations varies depending on the values of the inputs, and sometimes the inputs can completely disrupt flight computer operations. XFORGE has the potential to eliminate these types of GNC software failures by providing spacecraft developers specific implementations of GNC calculations that will prevent similar losses in future flight systems.

191,Broadband Vector Vortices for High Contrast Coronagraphy,"The requirement of detecting nearly ten orders of magnitude smaller signal of a planet compared to the nearby star puts forward extreme challenges for coronagraphs designed for exoplanet imaging. Vector vortex waveplates (VWs) appear to be capable of providing best performance compared to other mask technologies due to their structure as thin film coatings of continuous texture that minimizes light scattering noises and wavefront distortions even for high topological charge values. The nature of VWs as half-wave phase retarders provides opportunities of having high diffraction efficiency in a broad band of wavelengths in different parts of spectrum, from UV to IR. The pathways of reaching the ultimate performance features of VWs have proven elusive so far due to the great multitude of fundamental and technological factors influencing them. The Phase 1 study allowed us to identify architectures overcoming tradeoffs of contrast vs bandwidth, and relating those to manufacturability and tolerances. The unique knowledge gained in the Phase 1 on fundamental and technological issues of developing high contrast VWs will be used to setup fabrication and optical characterization systems adequate for meeting tolerances and specifications required for coronagraphs. The development will address technologies of multilayer liquid crystal polymers with precisely tuned intrinsic alignment and retardation. The fabrication systems would be enhanced with high precision coating, alignment, and curing systems in fully controlled environmental conditions, and with automated key processes for quality and yield. Direct contrast characterization systems in large dynamic range would complement high precision special test equipment with custom built opto-electronic systems.

192,Low-Power Long-Wavelength Infrared Sources for Tunable Laser Spectrometers on New Frontiers and Discovery Missions,"Following the success of the Tunable Laser Spectrometer (TLS) aboard the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover, laser-based spectroscopy instruments are likely to play a vital role in future planetary science missions within the Discovery and New Frontiers programs. By selectively targeting absorption lines of key atmospheric gases and their less abundant isotopologues across the infrared spectrum, next-generation TLS instruments can provide valuable information on the composition and origins of bodies throughout the solar system. Lasers emitting in the long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) regime between 7 to 10 µm are required to access absorption lines of several compounds of importance for planetary science; however, such lasers are currently unavailable with the low power consumption required for in situ instrument payloads. We propose to develop single-mode lasers based on semiconductor quantum cascade (QC) structures with emission wavelengths in the 7 to 10 µm spectral range. The laser sources will be designed specifically for module power consumption below 1 W at realistic instrument heat-sink temperatures, while targeting molecular absorption lines of interest for high-priority planetary missions. We will leverage the recent experience of the proposal the team members from JPL in successfully developing low-power mid-infrared QC lasers for portable laser spectrometers and the expertise of the team members from Eos Photonics in designing their proprietary high-efficiency QC active region structures. The proposed LWIR lasers will enable the development of tunable laser spectrometers for New Frontiers and Discovery missions, specifically to study the abundance and isotopic composition of sulfur dioxide for the New Frontiers Venus In Situ Explorer and isotopologues of ammonia and phosphine for the New Frontiers Saturn Probe, both identified as high-priority missions in the 2013-2022 Planetary Science Decadal Survey.

194,A 10 K Multistage Cryocooler with Very Low Vibration,"Advanced space-borne instruments require cooling at temperatures of 10 K and below. These coolers will be used for as upper-stage cryocoolers for sub-Kelvin cryocoolers and instruments or the primary cooler for electro-optical instruments. Cooling loads for these detectors will range from 0.25 W to 1.0 W at the primary load site, with additional loads at higher temperatures for other subsystems. Due to jitter requirements, a cryocooler with very low vibration is required. In addition, a multistage cooler, capable of providing refrigeration at more than one temperature simultaneously, can provide the greatest system efficiency and lowest mass. Turbomachine-based Brayton cryocoolers are ideal candidates for these applications because they are highly efficient, lightweight, vibration-free, multistage compatible, and have long maintenance-free lifetimes. Creare has developed state-of-the-art components needed to create turbo-Brayton cryocoolers for these missions. During the current program, we propose to develop and demonstrate a two-stage cryocooler that provides refrigeration at 10 K, with additional cooling at 60 to 70 K. On the Phase I project, we will optimize the performance of an existing cryocooler for a particular NASA mission class and measure its performance. During the Phase II project, we plan to build an advanced cold-stage turboalternator, integrate it with the cryocooler and measure its performance at cold load temperatures as low as 10 K. We will use the test results to develop a design for a fully optimized, flight cryocooler.

195,Geiger-Mode Avalanche Detector Array for Optical Communications,"Single-photon-counting detectors optimal for NASA long-range freespace optical telecommunications will be developed. The proposed effort addresses NASA’s need for reliable sources of radiation-hardened 1064-nm- and 1550-nm-sensitive single-photon photoreceivers for deep-space communications. There has been previous investment in single-photon-sensitive detector arrays; InGaAs APD pixels operating in Geiger mode (GM) are the most popular single-photon detectors in this spectral range as they do not require cryogenic cooling. However, performance improvements are need in InGaAs GM-APD focal-plane arrays (FPAs), and multiple reliable suppliers need to be established. To address this need, two growth and fabrication campaigns will be conducted. Each five-wafer growth campaign will include: single-element devices of various diameters, small-sized arrays, and larger-format GM-APD arrays. Characterization of the variable-diameter single-element devices, as a function of temperature and area/volume ratio, will be performed to identify sources of dark counts. Testing of arrays will be used to establish breakdown voltage uniformity, optical crosstalk, and yield. The demonstration of the performance of working GM-APD devices will significantly reduce the risk of the Phase II effort. In Phase II, large-format GM-APD arrays will be fabricated and hybridized to an existing deep-space communications readout integrated circuit (ROIC).

196,"Development of a Robust, Efficient Process to Produce Scalable, Superconducting kilopixel Far-IR Detector Arrays","We propose to develop and streamline the fabrication processes required to produce background limited large far-infrared arrays with large pixel numbers n ~10^5. We will achieve this goal by combining mature detector and readout technologies from our previous work, to fabricate a robust, close packed high sensitivity bolometer array with reliable high-quantum efficiency absorbers that operates over the entire FIR range and can be efficiently and reliably produced. The simplified process will integrate detector arrays through superconducting bonds to a cold readout multiplexer. It is very versatile in its applications, since it will allow the mating of TES detectors to time domain, frequency domain, microwave and code division multiplexers. The main objectives will be achieved by meeting the following goals: a) Develop a novel BUG architecture in which the superconducting through via proces is separated from the detector production, improving production speed and reducing risk. b) Production of background-limited 5-kilopixel arrays suitable for the FIR spectrometer Super-HIRMES. For the latter we will additionally: c) Refine our AlMn process for quickly and reliably fabricating TES with highly predictable and uniform transition temperatures (better less than 5% variation) across the entire wafer d) Refine a standard process for reliably fabricating impedance- matched and robust absorbers for the entire FIR wavelength range, which are not susceptible to room temperature aging

197,A Gravitational Wave Detector Based on an Atom Interferometer,"Gravitational waves are tiny perturbations in the curvature of space-time that arise from accelerating masses – according to Einstein's general theory of relativity. The first hint that these waves existed was spotted in 1974 as a gradual decrease in orbital period of pulsars. However, no one has directly detected a gravitational wave, not even the operational ground-based Advanced LIGO antennas. Our space-based gravity wave detector, equipped with Atom Interferometers (AI), has the potential to enable exciting science spanning the gamut from investigations of white dwarf binaries to spiralling black holes, and cosmologically significant phenomena like inflation. This new measurement approach, capable of higher, scientifically more interesting frequencies of operation, interferometer architecture, and mission concept would open a whole new window on the origin of our universe, heralding a deeper understanding of the fundamental laws of physics. Unlike light, Gravitational Waves (GW) permit observations beyond the so-called surface of last scattering; that is, before the white hot fog of hydrogen plasma cooled to give way to the formation of atoms. Goddard has teamed with Stanford to explore this innovative detector concept. We are proposing to analyze and better understand the realm of applicability of this new, ""disruptive"" technology of atomic interferometry for exploring GW physics. Cold atom-based inertial sensors have recently made it out of the laboratory and are in the process of being engineered and ruggedized for a variety of real-world applications in the fields of navigation and remote sensing, including some very demanding mission applications. Gravitational wave detection is arguably the most compelling scientific application for atomic quantum sensors of this sort in space.

198,Software Defined Reliability for Low Cost Digital Signal Processors on Small Spacecraft,"Software-based redundancy methods offer a solution to achieve high reliability with commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware, providing a significantly reduced development cycle as well as lower SWaP and cost. By contrast, conventional hardware-based methods for the use of high performance applications-specific processors in space are very costly and introduce a long delay between terrestrial and spaceflight use. This proposal investigates the use of Astrobotic’s Software Defined Reliability product, A-SDR, for the reliable use of COTS coprocessors in space through a specific study of a Texas Instruments digital signal processor (DSP) IC. A-SDR is a lightweight, low-overhead software consensus framework designed to detect and correct transient single event effects with minimal hardware requirements. With its software-based mitigation techniques, A-SDR can elevate this powerful multicore DSP IC to be flight-reliable, delivering 160 Gigaflops of computing power with a typical power consumption of less than 15 Watts. This capability is simply not available in space today and would have a broad impact on the autonomy of small spacecraft missions, and Astrobotic has identified a specific spaceflight application that requires this advanced computing performance to serve as a proof of concept: autonomous free-flying navigation in LEO and on planetary surfaces. Unlocking these high-performance computing applications will enable a new era of autonomy in spaceflight.

199,MULTI-SPECTRAL INFRARED CAMERA COVERING WAVELENGTHS FROM 1 TO 16 MICRONS,"QmagiQ proposes to develop and deliver to NASA a multi-spectral infrared camera covering a broad range of wavelengths from 1 micron to 16 microns. A key feature is a broadband high-quantum-efficiency strained layer superlattice focal plane array (SLS FPA) with spectral filters integrated directly on the FPA – a design that allows the camera to be very compact. The spectroscopic information provided by the filters will be useful in detecting and identifying a variety of hot and cold targets at great distances and inferring their chemistry. In Phase I, we will develop a SLS FPA with 16 micron cutoff wavelength, far past the normal 12 micron cutoff of commercial antimony-based SLS FPAs. In Phase II, we will optimize detector performance and expand array format to 1Kx1K, integrate filters onto the FPA, and package the FPA/filter assembly into a compact camera equipped for remote stand-alone operation. The camera will be valuable to NASA for space telescopes (where its much higher operating temperature compared to Si BIB detectors offers longer operating life) and for Earth and Planetary Science Decadal Survey priorities like infrared sounding. In addition to detecting, tracking and chemically analyzing fires, a drone equipped with such a multi-spectral camera can also be used to monitor and analyze vegetation, forests, crops, industrial gas leaks, and pollution.

200,Superconducting Magnetic Shielding Using Additive Manufacturing,"Transition edge sensors (TES) used in microcalorimeter arrays for X-ray photon detection are inherently susceptible to variations in the magnitude of magnetic fields since their detection principle is based on the transition between the normal and superconducting states. Optimal performance require efficient magnetic shielding to provide a low magnetic field environment. Bergen et al. provide magnetic field specifications with respect to SPON TES arrays. These specifications may become even more stringent for larger arrays. Current superconducting shield often consists of a superconducting cup arrangement as is the case proposed for the Lynx X-ray Microcalorimeter. Although this design reduces the number of joints, it is limited to the forming process and thereby the size and complexity of the shape that can be realized. Novel concepts for improving superconducting magnetic shielding such as superconducting inks or additive manufacturing are of interest for detector focal planes with challenging shielding geometries and other requirements. Novel concepts for improving superconducting magnetic shielding such as superconducting inks or additive manufacturing are of interest for detector focal planes with challenging shielding geometries and other requirements. Applied Nanotech proposes to use additive manufacturing (AM) for producing magnetic shields for shielding large and challenging shielding geometries. Our approach will be to apply a superconducting layer onto a substrate material such as amumetal, aluminum or polyimide (e.g. Kapton®).

201,Digital Schlieren System for Flow Diagnostics,"This is an SBIR proposal to develop a revolutionary digital schlieren imaging system that will greatly improve a widely used aerodynamics tool and render it so robust, user friendly, and productive that it will be useable in test facilities and environments that have been prohibitive before. Also, by incorporating recent advances in consumer camera and display technologies we can produce a new class of digital focusing schlieren (DFS) systems that drastically reduce the manufacturing costs as well as the size and weight, while maintaining sensitivity, improving robustness, making it more user friendly, and over all a much more powerful instrument. The digital schlieren concept represents the first major improvement in schlieren imaging in over 150 years, a true quantum jump in the technology. Conversion to digital obviates many of the long-standing problems with focusing schlieren systems that are associated with precisely matching the cutoff grid to the background light pattern. Because the system is digital, the control software can perform real-time image enhancement as well. Consequently, the most severe hardware production and alignment restrictions are now software problems that are solvable continuously, quickly, and inexpensively in real time. This capability enables the system to compute and compensate for imperfect windows and optics, optical aberrations, misalignments, and temporal changes in the system and subject.

202,Very High Gain and Low Noise Near Infrared Single Photon Counting Detectors and Arrays,"Amplification Technologies Inc (""ATI"") proposes to develop the enabling material and device technology for the design of ultra low noise, high gain and low cross-talk & after pulsing near-infrared single photon counting photodetectors and photodetector arrays sensitive in the eyesafe wavelengths of 1550 nm and 1800 nm spectral region for remote and atmospheric sensing applications, based on the already proven mechanism of internal discrete amplification technology. We plan to achieve this by integrating the internal discrete amplification device design that gave promising results and proved the concept of internal discrete amplification mechanism in the InP material system. The primary accomplishments from the Phase I effort would be the development of ultra low noise, high gain, low noise and low cross-talk & after pulsing near-infrared photodetectors and photodetector arrays sensitive in the 1550 nm and 1800 nm spectral region. The technology of internal discrete amplification enables the combination of high speed, very high gain and ultra low noise. This is possible because the internal discrete amplification nullifies the effect of impact ionization coefficients and prevents the edge break down, with high quantum efficiency and high speed of operation. These photodetectors can be used in eye-safe Lidar/Ladar, atmospheric sensing, 3D imaging, missile seekers, battlefield target identification and recognition system. Potential civilian applications include fiber-optic telecommunications, remote sensing and laser spectroscopy.

203,Gravity Observation and Dark energy Detection Explorer in the Solar System,"We propose further develop and mature the mission concept for direct detection of dark energy, the cause of the accelerating expansion of the universe, using the solar system as a laboratory. Dark energy may be a scalar field in nature. Its interaction with normal matter is assumed to have the gravitational strength on cosmological scales, but must be highly suppressed in the solar system to be consistent with current gravity measurements and observations. Nevertheless, various models of dark energy scalar fields can be probed with specifically designed precision measurement experiments. In Phase I, we have focused on the science and technology feasibility of such an experiment mission concept. By flying a constellation of long-baseline atom-interferometer gravity gradiometers and measuring the trace of the force field gradient tensor in the solar system, we will be able to isolate the new force field signal from overwhelmingly stronger gravity effects and achieve a direction detection of dark energy. A confirmed detection would lead to a fundamental shift in our understanding of physics and our universe, stimulating a wide variety of foundational research in cosmology and particle physics. The mission will also provide rich science data products for dark matter and gravitational wave detection as well as other modified Newtonian gravity analyses, leading to the concept of Gravity Observation and Dark energy Detection Explorer in the Solar System.

204,Processor Redundancy Enabled Software Event Recovery with Voting (PRESERV),"New processor architectures, such as ARM and RISC-V have greatly improved SWAP-C for the computational power that they provide, especially when compared to the systems that are currently relied on for spacecraft requiring robust computer hardware. ARM has seen wide adoption in the consumer space due to its low cost and efficiency and RISC-V has the potential to enable the introduction of custom chip designs at a much smaller scale than what is currently possible, thus opening the door to the potential usage of specialized custom silicon for use on space missions. The low cost and high efficiency of these processors makes redundant architectures feasible. Using the NASA Core Flight System (cFS), we develop a voting framework and couple it with a flight computer architecture that leverages redundant ARM commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) systems on a chip (SOCs) or a custom redundant RISC-V processor to create the Processor Redundancy Enabled Software Event Recovery with Voting (PRESERV). As the interest in small spacecraft missions grows, including missions beyond earth orbit, there is a need for robust and capable computer platforms for these vehicles. PRESERV meets these needs by combining the advantages of modern processor architectures and fault tolerance to give NASA new mission capabilities and provide a significant increase in robustness for low-cost spacecraft.

205,Digital Focusing Schlieren for Hypervelocity Ground Testing,"We propose to adapt a revolutionary digital focusing schlieren imaging technology to hypervelocity ground testing. Spectabit's digital focusing schlieren approach has greatly improved a widely used aerodynamics tool and rendered it so robust, user friendly, and productive that it can be used in test facilities and environments that have been prohibitive before. We have identified several key adaptations to this technology which can make it applicable to the submicrosecond time resolutions often required in hypervelocity testing environments. Some of these adaptations may be useful in other high-speed imaging techniques by enabling the suppression of laser speckle. The digital schlieren concept represents the first major improvement in schlieren imaging in over 150 years, a true quantum jump in the technology.

207,Efficient Neuromorphic Processor Design for Autonomous Space Operation,"It has been widely received that the recent success of artificial intelligence (AI) is built on three cornerstones: the advance of algorithms, the acquisition of big data, and the availability of high computing power. To further improve the data processing capability and efficiency, researchers, in general, explore from three orthogonal and complementary aspects: algorithm simplification and compression, computing architectures optimized for specific applications, and novel nano-devices that possess unique electrical properties, e.g., synapse- or neuro-alike behavior. These practices are respectively pursued by research societies of machine learning, computer architecture, and solid-state circuit and device. There lacks thorough and sufficient communications and coordination in between. As an example, the quantization of deep neural network (DNN) models often ignores the physical constraints on nano-devices like resistive memory (ReRAM, aka memristor), whose resistance suffers from different variation levels at different resistance values. The higher resistance level can also minimize the power consumption due to the reduced amplitude of the current participating in the computation. Carefully optimizing the quantization scheme of DNNs can achieve both high computational robustness and low power consumption of the ReRAM-based neuromorphic processor. Therefore, the Nanomatronix and University of Arkansas team propose to develop key enabling techniques for designing an efficient and robust ReRAM-based neuromorphic processor at the circuit, architecture, and algorithm levels, and to explore systematic approaches of vertically integrating these techniques through interactive cross-layer optimizations.

208,Dualband MW/LW Strained Layer Superlattice Focal Plane Arrays for Satellite-Based Wildfire Detection,"Infrared focal plane arrays (FPAs) based on Type-II strained layer superlattice (SLS) photodiodes have recently experienced significant advances. In Phase I we developed and delivered to NASA a 320x256 DUALBAND FPA integrated in a dewar cooler assembly (IDCA) that produces simultaneous and spatially-registered imagery in two spectral bands, namely, a fire channel in the 3-5 micron window and a thermal channel covering 8-12 microns. Such FPAs are known to be uniquely effective for detecting wildfires either locally from aircraft or globally from satellites in low earth orbit. The performance of SLS detectors now rivals that of mercury cadmium telluride but at a fraction of the cost. Their high quantum efficiency combined with the advantages of two-color imagery and data interpretation will permit the detection of wildfires with much reduced false alarm rates. The same devices will also enhance NASA's capabilities in a host of other satellite and airborne Earth-observing missions devoted to long-term global observations of the land surface, biosphere, atmosphere and oceans. They will also be instrumental in supporting future Space Science missions aimed at studying distant galaxies and discovering potentially habitable planets orbiting other stars. In Phase II we will expand dualband FPA format to 1280x1024 (12 micron pitch) and develop and deliver both a compact IDCA and camera so that NASA can field-test this promising new sensor technology for its wildfire-detection and other remote-sensing missions.

209,Collisional processes for astrophysics and mid/far-infrared astronomical spectroscopy,"Astronomical observations in the mid/far-infrared wavelengths continue to advance our understanding of the evolution of stars and galaxies. The fine structure emission lines in the mid/far-infrared wavelengths arising from, for example, highly-charged atomic ions (mid-IR) and oxygen atoms (far-IR) are important targets of observations with the NASA Astrophysics missions JWST and/or SOFIA, as well as the archival past missions Herschel, Spitzer, and the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO). In the case of ions, because they are created by high energy phenomena originating in cores and shocks of astronomical objects, their fine structure lines bridge data from these missions to data from, for example, Chandra, as well as to optical data from HST. The fine structure emission lines are highly valued diagnostics of energies and densities in galaxies, planetary nebulae, and stars and as probes of warm gases in circumstellar disks and outflows. Diagnostic values of the fine structure emission lines depend on the ionization potentials of the ions as well as their fine structure transitions (leading to emission lines) in response to collisions with electrons, hydrogen atoms, and other species. We will provide reliable calculations of fine structure changing collisions of [O I] and H, [Ne II] and H, and [Ne III] and H using a fully quantum-mechanical scattering approach. The associated excitation and cooling rate coefficients will be applicable to modeling of astrophysical phenomena observed using mid/far-infrared astronomical spectroscopy and traced through gas around active galactic nuclei and irradiated protoplanetary disks, with particular relevance to JWST/MIRI, including several Early Release Science projects. The data will lead to better models of ionic fine structure lines as diagnostics of astrophysical environments using spectroscopic observations from air- and space-borne missions in the mid- and far-infrared wavelengths.

The numerical models will predict refractive-index changes potentially induced by self-focusing, heat accumulation, thermal stress, plasma formation and relaxation, and ablation. The influence of focal conditions and laser parameters (pulse energy, wavelength, repetition rate, focal spot size, and scanning speed) on waveguide quality and geometry will be theoretically and experimentally investigated via sensitivity studies. The index modulation will be evaluated for the three major waveguide-design configurations (Type I, II, and III) using matrices of laser parameters. The effectiveness of the three types of waveguide configurations will be compared for laser materials. To prepare for Phase II, the technical feasibility of producing waveguide lasers will be accessed through numerical modeling. Concepts for developing a waveguide laser will be identified. This innovation will enable the fabrication of low-loss optical waveguides for integrated photonic circuits with the integrated active and passive devices on the micron scale. It will provide weight, power and cost reductions for tele-communications, advanced data centers, and free-space communications. The femtosecond-laser-enabled compact three-dimensional waveguides and waveguide-laser sources provide a unique platform for versatile photonic applications to remote sensing, analog RF, quantum computing and biomedical monitoring, and others.

Of special interest to NASA are missions to Ocean Worlds (Titan, Enceladus, Ganymede, Europa…) as well as permanently shadowed regions of the Moon, comets, and high latitude winters on Mars. Meeting the scientific goals of these missions relies on revolutionizing current spacecraft and instrument technologies to achieve long life, high resolution and sensitivity but with low mass and power requirements. Our goal is to formulate and demonstrate an extreme environment electronics characterization and modeling methodology to demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing selected commercial electronic components for in-situ operation during NASA’s missions to extremely cold environments.Our objective is to formulate and develop extreme environment electronic characterization and modeling methodologies that quantify the extended operating range of commercial components. This will enable the development of qualified high reliability electronic components capable of in-situ operation during NASA’s missions to extremely cold environments. We have used a spacecraft subsystem as a pathfinder catalyst for validation and proof of concept demonstration of our objectives. The extended operating range of the candidate components identified through the smart search will be validated through empirical evaluation that includes temperature dependent electronic reliability experiments, low temperature radiation evaluation, life test and failure analysis studies .

212,Low SWaP UHV chamber for atom interferometer,"To meet NASA’s interest in advancing quantum sensing technologies, the development and maturation towards space application and qualification of atomic systems are needed. Atom interferometers have unmatched precision for in-situ measurements of local gravity acceleration. The Size, Weight, and Power consumption (SWaP) of existing atom interferometers is a major obstacle for employing them in NASA missions. One of the main components of an atom interferometer is an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) system. UHV chambers are typically the heaviest components of atom interferometers. A light, compact, and energy-efficient UHV system will be highly beneficial for NASA missions. In this proposal, Q-Peak is addressing the need for lighter, compact, energy-efficient UHV systems suitable for atom interferometer. In particular, we propose to use an aluminum alloy that is 30% lighter than stainless steel to reduce an UHV chamber weight. The aluminum alloy can be machined using a metallic powder bed fusion process that removes the constraint of traditional manufacturing considerations. Furthermore, Q-Peak will focus on developing passive pumping based on non-evaporable getter pumps. Passive pumping can reduce the energy consumption of an UHV system. Other aspects of the UHV system suitable for atom cooling experiment will be addressed: bonding vacuum windows to the aluminum alloy, energy-efficient and reliable alkali-atom sources, and so on. The developed UHV system will find direct application to atom interferometers, drastically reducing their SWaP without compromising residual gas pressure and optical access.

The technology consolidates both new and existing software, algorithms, and data structures into an on-line, high-performance service. It is based on four core components: 1. The Trajectory Graph Data Structure, used for management, traversal, and persistent storage of available transfers. 2. The Search Strategy Interface, used for interaction between the graph and existing or new software and algorithms for rapid exploration of transfer options near and around planets, satellites, and small bodies. 3.

214,High Efficiency 4 K Cryocooler for Space Missions,"Future astrophysics missions require efficient, low-temperature cryocoolers to cool advanced instruments or serve as the upper stage cooler for sub-Kelvin refrigerators. Potential astrophysics missions include Lynx, the Origin Space Telescope, and the Superconducting Gravity Gradiometer. Cooling loads for these missions are up to 300 mW at temperatures of 4 to 10 K, with additional loads at higher temperatures for other subsystems. Due to low jitter requirements, a cryocooler with very low vibration is needed for many missions. In addition, a multi-stage cooler, capable of providing refrigeration at more than one temperature simultaneously, can provide the greatest system efficiency with the lowest mass. Turbo-Brayton cryocoolers have space heritage and are ideal for these missions due to negligible vibration emittance and high efficiency at low temperatures. The primary limitation in implementing Brayton cryocoolers at temperatures below 10 K has been the development of high efficiency turbines. On the proposed program, Creare plans to leverage recent developments in gas bearing technology and low-temperature alternators to realize a high-efficiency, low-temperature turbine. On the Phase I project, we will perform a proof-of-concept demonstration of the turbine technology at temperatures down to 4 K. On the Phase II project, we will build and demonstrate an advanced low-temperature turbine at temperatures of 4 to 10 K.

215,Polymer Derived Ceramic Nanocomposites for Advanced Thermoelectrics,"In order to continue exploring deep space and to create the capabilities of allowing manned exploration to Mars and beyond, NASA has stated that it is vital to develop new power generation technologies that can power our future spacecraft more efficiently while simultaneously minimizing mass and maintaining reliability. Thermoelectric devices provide a simple way to convert heat into electricity without any moving parts promoting long-term, maintenance free operation. However, current state-of-the-art technologies are limited in that they achieve an operational efficiency of around 6-7%, are made of expensive and hazardous materials, and require a very large thermal gradient in order to produce any useable power. Over the last decade, theoretical and experimental work has proved that nanostructuring of the thermoelectric materials provides a very promising means for effectively increasing the operational efficiency through means of quantum confinement. Through quantum confinement, it has been shown that the electrical and thermal transport of a material can be decoupled and provide a means of increasing the efficiency through increasing the figure-of-merit, given by ZT=Î±2ÏƒT/Îº, where Î± is Seebeck coefficient, Ïƒ is electrical conductivity, and Îº is thermal conductivity. While various types of materials have been used to fabricate thermoelectrics with a decent ZT, thermally and chemically stable thermoelectric materials made from earth abundant materials are still required for deep space exploration. The research proposed within aims to further explore this area of nanostructured thermoelectrics by creating a new thermoelectric material based off of polymer-derived ceramics. Polymer-derived ceramics (PDCs) are a class of silicon-based, amorphous ceramic materials that are created through the thermal decomposition of polymeric precursors. PDCs offer a very high thermal stability (~1300-1500oC), have a high mechanical strength, as well as oxidation, corrosion, and irradiation stability. Like their polymeric precursors, they also possess an inherently low thermal conductivity. However, simple PDCs face the challenges of low electrical conductivity and charge carrier densities. It is hypothesized that 1) introducing anisotropic graphene fillers into the amorphous SiCN PDC matrix improves the charge transport efficiency but does not contribute significantly to phonon transport due to multiple length scale scattering; 2) the band structure of SiCN can be tuned for efficient charge transfer at SiCN/carbon interfaces; and 3) incorporating nickel nanoparticles into SiCN composite increases the scattering of low-energy electrons and reduces the electron-phonon coupling, leading to an increase of the figure-of-merit. To validate these hypotheses, I will first synthesize and characterize pure polymer-derived SiCN ceramics and the graphene/nanoparticle embedded SiCN nanocomposites followed by a synergistic structural characterization to understand how the ceramic composition and pyrolysis temperature affect the ceramic structures. The subsequent evaluation and comparison of the thermoelectric properties of pure SiCN and SiCN nanocomposites will reveal the effect of graphene, metal nanoparticles, and nanoscale structures on the charge carrier density, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and the figure-of-merit ZT. Such understandings will provide scientific guidelines for the design, synthesis, and applications of PDC composites with significantly improved thermoelectric performance.

216,Implementing a Near-Optimal Optical Receiver for Inter-Planetary Communication,"Proposal Objective: Interplanetary communications signals are inherently weak at the receiver. In fact, for a desired data rate the received optical pulses may contain less than even a single photon. By exploiting both a novel optical receiver architecture and a newly demonstrated quantum switch, I propose to design, construct, and characterize a proof-of-principle implementation of a near-optimal optical transceiver suitable for Earth-Mars communications. Key Methods and Techniques: This proposal relies on two novel discoveries: (1) a new receiver architecture, recently proposed by Guha [1], which allows near-optimal communications using individual pulses which each contain far less than a single photon, and (2) an ultra-fast, low-loss, coherent, single-photon optical switch - exactly the type of revolutionary quantum switch recently developed in the Kumar group [2,3]. This proposal's key methods and techniques involve the successful exploitation of both innovations. Unlike typical receiver architectures, the Guha receiver assumes that loss has degraded a transmitted signal to the point where each transmitted pulse contains less than a single photon. By encoding the data to be transmitted into a large number of these very weak pulses, each in their own spatial mode, and then combining these many weak pulses into a single pulse bright enough to be detected, the Guha receiver can approach the optimal communications rate. This increase in system capacity is known as superadditivity [4]. Although the Guha receiver, in principle, allows for increased capacity there are practical problems with implementing a multi-spatial-mode inter-planetary communications system. In an Earth-Mars communication system, for example, any distinct spatial modes at the transmitter will completely overlap by the time the signal reaches the receiver. Fortunately, many of these problems can be avoided by redesigning the Guha receiver as a temporally, rather than spatially encoded architecture. Implementing the Guha architecture for temporally encoded signals requires a device which can manipulate, with very low loss and at very high speeds, the individual temporal modes of a single photon. In other words, a quantum optical switch is needed.  My group has recently demonstrated just such an all-optical, ultra-fast (200-ps switching window), low-loss (1.5dB), high switching contrast (120:1) device [2-3]. This single photon switch is a nonlinear optical loop mirror whose reflectivity is controlled by a separate pump pulse. I propose to combine multiple switches in a temporal Guha architecture in order to implement a proof-of-principle near-optimal optical receiver suitable for Earth-Mars communications. Significance of Proposed Research: Deep-space communications involve extremely high loss. While signal strength can be recovered by increasing detection time, this strongly limits the data rate. However, a recently proposed joint detection receiver has the potential to dramatically increase these rates, approaching the Holevo limit even when each transmitted pulse, after an enormous transmission loss, contains far less than a single photon. I propose to construct a proof-of-principle implementation of a modified Guha receiver using ultra-fast, low-loss, single photon switching technology. If successful, this project could lead to the deployment of high-rate communications systems for future NASA missions. References: [1] S. Guha, Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 240502 (2011). [2] M.

217,Radiation-Hardened I/O Expansion Chip,"VORAGO Technologies will create a rad-hard I/O Expansion Chip for next generation spaceflight processor devices, including the High-Performance Spaceflight Computing (HPSC) Chiplet. The I/O Expansion chip will have multiple high-speed interfaces so that it can interface with a space processor and support high speed communications. It will also have programmable-voltage-level GPIO to support both non-differential communications protocols and general I/O expansion. The I/O expansion chip will provide dedicated hardware on the IC to support each of the communications protocols. The I/O expansion chip will also include an appropriate amount of memory and a multi-channel Direct Memory Access controller system to support simultaneous high-speed communications. To optimize power consumption, multiple PLL sources will be available on-chip to provide the appropriate clock generation for the on-chip communications controllers. An ARM® A5 processor core will be included on the I/O Expansion Chip so that it can be used autonomously from the spaceflight processor device. This feature is expected to give the system designer good options for system level power saving modes as well as more system fault management capabilities. The I/O Expansion chip will be implemented using VORAGO Technologies proven radiation-hardening HARDSIL® technology. HARDSIL technology will make the I/O Expansion chip immune from latch-up.

218,Model-based Enterprise Architecture for Institutional Management Digital Twins,"Global Technology Connection, Inc. and its university partners propose a structured, model-based approach to the definition and development of Institutional Management Digital Twins that is guided by architectural and Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) practices and principles. The proposed technical approach identifies a series of steps aimed at guiding engineers through such digital twin development tasks.

219,A Ferroelectric Semiconductor Absorber for Surpassing the Shockley-Queisser Limit,"Physical Sciences Inc. (PSI) proposes to develop new solar cells based on a ferroelectric semiconductor absorber material that can yield a 30% increase in efficiency and a 20% increase in specific power compared with current triple-junction III-V cells. These gains will be realized by exploiting a unique charge separation mechanism in ferroelectrics that enables open-circuit voltages many times the band gap, leading to maximum power conversion efficiencies exceeding the conventional Shockley-Queisser limit (33%). PSI and team members will create photovoltaic cells based on Earth-abundant SnS stabilized in a ferroelectric state by epitaxial strain engineering. By combining above-gap cell voltages with the high absorption coefficient (45% is anticipated to be achievable. Importantly, these cells will also offer improved radiation resistance due to the reduced carrier diffusion lengths required by the unique ferroelectric charge separation mechanism. During Phase I, PSI, guided by first-principles calculations conducted by the PARADIM Center at Cornell University, will demonstrate room-temperature ferroelectric ordering in SnS through epitaxial strain engineering. During Phase II, PSI and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory will demonstrate the potential of the proposed absorber by achieving above-band gap open-circuit voltages in prototype cells. During a Phase III effort, the efficiency of these cells will be increased to a target value of 45% through reduction of intrinsic defects, leading to substantial improvements in cell size, weight, and power output.

220,Asynchronous Geiger-mode photon counting arrays for deep space optical communications,"Long range laser optical communications offer advantages of higher bandwidth and better accuracy over RF communications. NASA has demonstrated higher bandwidth data transmission using laser optical communication links. Recently, MIT-LL designed and delivered high sensitive Geiger-mode avalanche photodiode (Gm-APD) array receiver as a flight unit for the NASA's deep space communication demonstration program. This will be a first successful demonstration of a Gm-APD receiver technology in space. For many future missions, improvement in detection efficiency, radiation hardness, larger format and space qualifiable Gm-APD photon counting array receivers are needed. We propose a space qualifiable 1064 nm InGaAsP Gm-APD photon counting array receiver with improved photon detection efficiency (PDE). PDE will be improved by increasing the quantum efficiency using reflective layers and increasing the carrier avalanche probability. Our mesa design with a proprietary passivation process offers low dark count rates and improved radiation hardness, In Phase I we plan to demonstrate a 1064 nm InGaAsP Gm-APD photon counting array sensor chip assembly using high detection efficiency arrays. Furthermore, working with NASA, we will establish requirements for a space qualifiable receiver array. The successful completion of Phase I will demonstrate the technical feasibility of a photon counting array receiver with improved sensitivity. In Phase II, we will design, build, and demonstrate a radiation hard 32 x 32 photon counting array receiver with improved sensitivity. We will conduct radiation tests to demonstrate improved radiation hardness. We will deliver an engineering development unit to NASA for evaluation. In addition, we will deliver a flight ready receiver design that will meet specifications for a space mission.

221,Efficient Neuromorphic Processor Design for Autonomous Space Operation,"According to the NASA SBIR topic H6.22 description entitled “Deep Neural Net and Neuromorphic Processors for In-Space Autonomy and Cognition,” this subtopic “specifically focuses on advances in signal and data processing. Neuromorphic processing will enable NASA to meet growing demands for applying artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms on-board a spacecraft to optimize and automate operations. It has been widely received that the recent success of artificial intelligence (AI) is built on three cornerstones: the advance of algorithms, the acquisition of big data, and the availability of high computing power. To further improve the data processing capability and efficiency, researchers, in general, explore from three orthogonal and complementary aspects: algorithm simplification and compression, computing architectures optimized for specific applications, and novel nano-devices that possess unique electrical properties, e.g., synapse- or neuro-alike behavior. These practices are respectively pursued by research societies of machine learning, computer architecture, and solid-state circuit and device. There lacks thorough and sufficient communications and coordination in between. As an example, the quantization of deep neural network (DNN) models often ignores the physical constraints on nano-devices like resistive memory (ReRAM, aka memristor), whose resistance suffers from different variation levels at different resistance values. The higher resistance level can also minimize the power consumption due to the reduced amplitude of the current participating in the computation. Carefully optimizing the quantization scheme of DNNs can achieve both high computational robustness and low power consumption of the ReRAM-based neuromorphic processor.

222,Carbon Nanotube Thermal Interface Materials for Enhanced Thermal Management Project,"Thermal interface materials (TIMs) couple heat sources, such as high speed high performance microprocessors, to heat sinks and are critical for efficient thermal management and reliable device operation. A quality TIM has a thermal conductivity (k) approaching 2 W/m-K. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are ballistic thermal conductors (k~2500 W/m-K for individual multi-walled CNTs) which have the potential to greatly improve heat transfer and consequently device performance. The near future of spacecraft will likely be more autonomous, require more processing power, and may include the use of multicore processors or next generation FPGAs. These high thermal density devices can create local hotspots which can hinder device performance and reduce reliability. Highly oriented mats of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with their extremely high thermal conductivity (k ~ 2500 W/m-K for individual multi-walled CNTs) have the potential to improve the performance and reliability of these devices by functioning as a thermal superhighway, maximizing heat transfer away from the source. Successful implementation of CNTs as a thermal interface material (TIM) would be a significant improvement over the status quo as current quality TIMs are in the form of metal or ceramic filled polymers and greases with thermal conductivities ranging from 0.5 to 2 W/m-K. Implementation of CNT TIMs has been limited due to insufficient thermal and mechanical coupling of the CNTs to secondary and tertiary (i.e. non-growth) surfaces. The investigators have proposed a method to improve the thermal and mechanical coupling of CNTs to these surfaces. In this study the investigators will examine theoretical CNT-substrate interfaces for sources of thermal resistance (phonon scattering) and effective coupling for a variety of metallic substrates. Phonon (quantized lattice vibrations) propagation and dispersion at the interface will be investigated using atomistic and quantum mechanical models and the theoretical potential of heat transfer across the examined interfaces evaluated for potential future work.

223,Compact and rugged mid-infrared multi-gas open path sensor,"We propose a turn-key in-situ gas sensor that can reliably perform continuous measurements on airborne, ship-based, or other mobile platforms. Specifically, we emphasize that the proposed system is compact, lightweight, power efficient, and therefore can be mounted on small to mid-sized un-crewed aircraft systems. The sensor features a small (centimeter scale) exposed beam path that allows ambient air circulation without active gas sampling. The proposed sensor is based on mid-infrared absorption spectroscopy using Pendar’s proprietary distributed feedback quantum cascade laser array (QCLA) technology. Our monolithically integrated chip-scale coherent source can withstand harsh operating conditions while offering superior wavelength and intensity stability compared to other broadband mid-infrared sources. Broadband spectral coverage (up to 500 cm-1) combined with high frequency resolution (~100 MHz) enable a multi-tasking sensor capable of detecting a multitude of gases including toxic industrial chemicals, chemical warfare agents, greenhouse gases, and volatile organic compounds. The laser source can rapidly tune over a large bandwidth to provide fast spectral measurements, enabling >100 Hz time response. Absorption measurements in the mid-infrared fingerprinting region ensures that a small pathlength is sufficient to reach uncertainty levels of <1% even when operating on moving platforms. By the end of Phase I, we will have built a prototype sensor and experimentally demonstrated that the sensor can reach targeted sensitivities under simulated flight conditions.

224,"Snow and Water: Imaging Spectroscopy for coasts and snow cover
		
			(SWIS)","This proposal addresses the NASA Earth Science focus areas of Carbon Cycle & Ecosystems, and Water & Energy Cycle. We will develop and demonstrate a scalable imaging spectrometer system that is suitable for small satellites, including CubeSats. Deploying a small number of such satellites is a cost-effective way to close the gap in high spatial and temporal resolution measurements over targeted areas of the Earth's surface. The technology enhances the ability of future NASA missions to address critical science in two localized regions of the Earth: the coastal zone and snow/ice covered mountains. In both cases, high-fidelity imaging spectrometer measurements are needed with comparatively frequent revisit. The high dynamic range needed to sample both bright (snow) and dark (ocean) targets requires a unique and innovative design, as proposed here. Compelling scientific questions can be addressed in both cases with the different orbits of 30–60 m resolution with weekly sampling, and 120–180 m resolution with near daily global revisit times. To address these questions we will demonstrate a high-uniformity, low-polarization sensitivity imaging spectrometer operating in the 350–1700 nm spectral region. We will also demonstrate an on-board calibration system to address the stringent radiometric stability and knowledge that these missions require. The dynamic range of the spectrometer is achieved through high throughput, rapid readout rate, and programmable integration time. A new HgCdTe detector array, optimized for high temperature operation will be fabricated. The array will also feature a linear variable anti-reflection coating to enhance quantum efficiency and minimize backscatter. A CubeSat-compatible assembly comprising the optomechanical system, detector array, and on-board calibrator will be tested in thermal vacuum and vibrated to typical launch loads. The period of performance is three years with an assumed start of April 2014. The entry and exit TRL are 4 and 6 respectively.Develop and demonstrate a scalable imaging spectrometer system that is suitable for small satellites, including cubesats, and with performance characteristics that can address the demanding observational requirements for monitoring coastal ecosystems as well as snow covered areas, including: - high-fidelity imaging spectrometer measurements - high temporal sampling - high spatial resolution - high dynamic range to cover both bright (snow) and dark (ocean) targets

225,Doped Chiral Polymer Negative Index Materials (DCPNIM),"Doped Chiral Polymer-Negative Index Materials (DCP-NIM) with tunable resonance frequencies are developed by adding various plasmonic nanoinclusions into chiral polymers. Amplifying the chiral parameter while lowering the real part of the permittivity can achieve an NIM metamaterial without having a negative permeability and a complex physical architecture. Novel lightweight, flexible DCP-NIMs can offer compact devices capable of dynamic beam steering, beam dispersion reduction, optical limiters.Theoretical quantum chemical and electromagnetic (EM) modeling studies predict that materials with enhanced chiral parameter and suppressed permittivity create NIM without having a negative permeability [Opt. Exp. 15, 5730 (2007)]. Self-assembled helical structures of chiral molecules enhance the chiral parameters, while incorporating plasmonic inclusions, such as metal nanoparticles and nanotubes, efficiently lower the permittivity. The ratio of radius and pitch, polarizable moieties, and delocalized pi-electrons of the helical molecules influence the chiral parameter. Recent studies report that aligned liquid crystal polymers (LCPs) containing nano-inclusions create a new type of metamaterial whose index of refraction is tunable from negative to positive [Opt. Lett. 31, 2592 (2006)]. The resonance frequency can be tuned in a wide spectral range by controlling the refractive index of the LCP and the nature of the nano-inclusions. Recently, we have demonstrated negative permittivity materials by doping a non-chiral polymer with phosphoric acid or carbon nanotubes to obtain altered resonance frequencies ranging from kHz to GHz respectively. The resonance frequency can be tuned as a function of the dopant and the concentration [J. Appl. Poly. Sci. Early View]. By introducing aligned helical polymers with proper dopants or plasmonic nano-inclusions, novel lightweight, flexible NIM can be created with tunable resonance frequencies without complex physical architecture and negative permeability. The resonance frequency and magnitude of the NIM can be tailored for specific applications by judiciously selecting the chiral matrix and nano-inclusions. The resonance frequency of DCP-NIM can be further tuned by the composition, size, aspect ratio, and orientation (alignment) of these chiral matrix and nano-inclusions to cover a wide range of the EM spectrum from UV/Vis to infrared ranges, extended to microwave.

226,A 1.5k x 1.5k class photon counting HgCdTe linear avalanche photo-diode array for low background space astronomy in the 1 – 5 micron infrared.,"Under a current award, NASA NNX 13AC13G “EXTENDING THE ASTRONOMICAL APPLICATION OF PHOTON COUNTING HgCdTe LINEAR AVALANCHE PHOTO-DIODE ARRAYS TO LOW BACKGROUND SPACE OBSERVATIONS” UH has used Selex SAPHIRA 320 x 256 MOVPE L-APD HgCdTe arrays developed for Adaptive Optics (AO) wavefront (WF) sensing to investigate the potential of this technology for low background space astronomy applications. After suppressing readout integrated circuit (ROIC) glow, we have placed upper limits on gain normalized dark current of 0.01 e-/sec at up to 8 volts avalanche bias, corresponding to avalanche gain of 5, and have operated with avalanche gains of up to several hundred at higher bias. We have also demonstrated detection of individual photon events.  The proposed investigation would scale the format to 1536 x 1536 at 12um (the largest achievable in a standard reticule without requiring stitching) while incorporating reference pixels required at these low dark current levels. The primary objective is to develop, produce and characterize a 1.5k x 1.5k at 12um pitch MOVPE HgCdTe L-APD array, with nearly 30 times the pixel count of the 320 x 256 SAPHIRA, optimized for low background space astronomy. This will involve: 1) Selex design of a 1.5k x 1.5k at 12um pitch ROIC optimized for low background operation, silicon wafer fabrication at the German XFab foundry in 0.35 um 3V3 process and dicing/test at Selex, 2) provision by GL Scientific of a 3-side close-buttable carrier building from the heritage of the HAWAII xRG family, 3) Selex development and fabrication of 1.5k x 1.5k at 12 um pitch MOVPE HgCdTe L-APD detector arrays optimized for low background applications, 4) hybridization, packaging into a sensor chip assembly (SCA) with initial characterization by Selex and, 5) comprehensive characterization of low background performance, both in the laboratory and at ground based telescopes, by UH. The ultimate goal is to produce and eventually market a large format array, the L-APD equivalent of the Teledyne H1RG and H2RG, able to achieve sub-electron read noise and count 1 – 5 um photons with high quantum efficiency and low dark count rate while preserving their Poisson statistics and noise.

227,High-Efficiency Modified Collins Cycle Cryocooler,"Existing space qualified cryocoolers are typically Stirling and pulse-tube type cryocoolers that achieve compactness and reliability by adopting mechanically simple cold head configurations, at the expense of thermodynamic efficiency. Large terrestrial cryogenic refrigerators achieve higher thermodynamic efficiencies but use mechanically complex designs that are not feasible at a small scale. The ideal space cryocooler would have the efficiency of a large terrestrial machines, but with the compactness and reliability of a pulse-tube or Stirling cryocooler. A cryocooler concept approaching this ideal has been investigated and achieves compactness and reliability by using microelectronics to enable complex valve timing in a mechanically simple and efficient design. It is based upon a modification of the Collins cycle. Key component technologies include floating piston expanders and electromagnetic Smart Valves have been demonstrated in a prototype low-temperature cryocooler stage. Cryocoolers are an enabling technology for space missions viewing in the infrared, gamma-ray and x-ray spectrums, providing the necessary environment for low temperature detectors and sensors, as well as for telescopes and instrument optics on infrared observatories. Detectors and sensors provide better imaging performance at lower temperature. The Mid Infrared Instrument (MIRI) of the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope includes a 7K cryocooler for detector cooling. The next generation of space telescopes include the LYNX (X-ray surveyor) and Origins Space Telescope (far IR surveyor) that are planned for launch in 2030. A 4K 4-stage pulse tube cryocooler from Lockheed Martin is the current baseline design for the LYNX mission, with expected electrical power is 10,000 W per Watt of cooling at 4K. The proposed Modified Collins Cycle is expected to reduce the power draw for 4K cooling to about 2,000 W per Watt of cooling

228,"High-Speed, Low-Noise, Radiation-Tolerant CCD Image Sensors for Strategic High-Energy Astrophysics Missions","NASA's 2016 Physics of the Cosmos Program Annual Technology Report (PATR) identifies ‘fast, low-noise, megapixel X-ray imaging arrays’ as a top-priority technology development need for future strategic astrophysics missions.  The Lynx large mission concept now under study by NASA for presentation to the 2020 Decadal Survey in Astronomy and Astrophysics, in particular, includes a notional high-definition X-ray imaging instrument requiring a combination of readout rate, noise, spatial resolution and size that cannot be furnished by currently-mature technologies.    We have been developing a new generation of charge-coupled device (CCD) detectors with the aim of meeting this need. X-ray imaging CCDs have been flown successfully for more than twenty years, and state of the art devices provide low noise and near-theoretical spectral resolution, as well as spatial resolution and size approaching that required for Lynx.  However, Lynx requires detector readout rates more than two orders of magnitude faster than current technology, with no compromise in noise or spectral resolution. This performance must be achieved within the instrument power and mass constraints and maintained over the expected lifetime of a strategic mission.  We propose to advance the readiness of CCD technology to meet these requirements by capitalizing on developments at MIT Lincoln Laboratory for other applications which also require fast, large format, low-noise, low-power imagers. Building on high-speed prototype CCD X-ray detectors currently operating in our laboratory, we aim to fabricate and demonstrate devices with lower noise, better low-energy quantum efficiency, and improved radiation tolerance.

229,"Low Size, Weight, and Power, High Gain 2D Material-Based Detectors for Mass Spectrometers","This project will assess the feasibility of using low power, high intrinsic amplification 2D material ion detectors for mass spectrometry to lower mass, power, and volume of mass spectrometers. Guardion’s proposed solution is to eliminate the need of high voltage electron multipliers utilizing patented 2D material-based ion detectors that provide intrinsic charge to current amplification values ranging between 1E6-1E9 A/C, and only require an operating bias of 0.1V. It further distinguishes between positive and negative ions, and works from atmospheric pressure through ultra high vacuum. Unlike conventional methods of detection used in mass spectrometry, our sensors will exploit a low-bias intrinsic quantum gain mechanism in nanomaterials to amplify the signal from trace amounts of ions. This eliminates the need for external amplification, eliminates high voltage requirements, and significantly reduces power consumption. We will first develop test devices in an ultra high vacuum compatible assembly. We will then modify an existing mass filter to direct ions towards our detector assembly and compare against a commercial off the shelf residual gas analyzer. We will then modify a standalone single quadrupole mass spec to accommodate our device assembly to test higher mass ranges. We will then evaluate sensor response to mass range, sampling rate, charge state, and ion energy. Finally, we will generate a report assessing the sensor performance, benefits, and limitations with suggestions on what types of mass spec and missions would be benefitted for sensor adoption.

230,"Biomedical Monitoring by a Novel Noncontact Radio Frequency Technology, Year 1","The area of Space Health and Medicine is one of the NASA's Space Technology Grand Challenges. Space is an extreme environment which is not conducive to human life. The extraterrestrial environment can result in the deconditioning of various human physiological systems and thus require easy to use physiological monitoring technologies in order to better monitor space crews for appropriate health management and successful space missions and space operations. Furthermore, the Space Technology Roadmap's Technology Area Breakdown Structure calls for improvements in research to support human health and performance (Technology Area 06). To address these needs, this project investigated a potential noncontact and noninvasive radio frequency-based technique of monitoring central hemodynamic function in human research subjects in response to orthostatic stress. This technology will be a quantum advance in cardiac monitoring and will be applicable in numerous situations such as for immediate assessment and monitoring of patients in life-threatening emergencies, during environmental stressors, and in performance of hazardous occupational tasks. Because the RFII data can be monitored from a central location, multiple devices could be used to monitor several patients simultaneously, such as in a car accident with multiple injured victims. For NASA these benefits will apply to both flight and ground personnel. For the military this device can be used during actual combat to alert medical personnel when a service member is wounded and to monitor his/her condition even before help is provided thus lowering medical evaluation times. This can also be used to aid medical personnel allowing them to prioritize triage and evacuation in multiple casualty contingencies. The goal for this project is to design, develop and advance technology for a near-instantaneous, non-invasive radio frequency-based method for measuring heart and lung function without invasive probes, cuffs, electrodes and without patient contact.

231,"Deep UV Semiconductor Sourcess for Advanced Planetary Science Instruments, Phase I","This proposal addresses the need for miniature deep UV light sources that operate at very low ambient temperatures without heating or temperature regulation for use in advanced in situ planetary science instruments involved in the reagent-less detection and identification of trace amounts of organic, inorganic, and biogenic materials.  The proposed sources are aluminum gallium nitride (AlGaN) semiconductor lasers and light emitting devices emitting between 210 nm to 250 nm, a spectral range which has been demonstrated to provide higher detection sensitivity and chemical differentiability than sources emitting at longer wavelengths.  Instrument applications include non-contact, robot-arm or body mounted, reagentless chemical imaging instruments and detectors for analysis of chemical extractions from soil, rock, or ice employing non-contact, non-destructive native fluorescence and/or resonance Raman spectroscopic methods.   	The proposed semiconductor source approach avoids the problems that continue to limit emission wavelengths of semiconductor lasers to wavelengths above 340 nm.  Using free electron injection we have demonstrated internal quantum efficiencies over 100 times higher than reported elsewhere.  It is the goal of this program to demonstrate deep UV laser emission from a semiconductor device less than 250 nm using the proposed approach.  This will lead to miniature, high efficiency, TRL 4 devices.

232,Adaptive Thermal Infrared Band ROIC for Planetary Science Missions,"Electro-Optical and Infrared (EO/IR) detectors sensing in the 400nm to 13 micron waveband are extensively employed in planetary science space instruments. These detectors can be divided into two distinctive subgroups, namely the visible through shortwave infrared (SWIR) band detectors (400nm – 2500nm), and the mid-wave infrared (MWIR – 3um to 5um) and long-wave infrared (LWIR 8um – 13um) thermal bands detectors. Each of these two categories requires a readout integrated circuit (ROIC) optimized for the specific subgroup to efficiently multiplex and readout the photocurrent from the photodiodes. The first ROIC type optimized for shorter wavelength bands needs to have the following characteristics: Smaller pixel pitch (near 10um) optimized for Nyquist spatial sensing of shorter wavelengths. High gain (smaller well size) to provide good SNR for low flux sensing since these bands have lower irradiance and typically use a narrower bandwidth filter. The second ROIC type optimized for longer thermal wavelength bands needs to have the following characteristics: Larger pixel pitch (near 20-25um) to match the blur spot size for Nyquist sampling of longer wavelengths. Lower gain (large well size) to provide good SNR for high flux sensing since these bands have higher irradiance and typically use a wider bandwidth filter. There is an established need to develop a novel ROIC for thermal bands being used for planetary science. Our team has extensive space mission experience to provide NASA with an optimal solution. The proposed ROIC will provide the desired high well capacity, a high frame rate, a large format, space qualifiable design, while simultaneously keeping the cold space power very low. Such as ROIC will be suitable for all typical detector types used for these bands, such as (but not limited to) quantum well IR photodetectors (QWIP), HgCdTe (MCT), and strained-layer superlattices (SLS).

233,A Networked Flight Dynamics Platform for Collaborative Design and Optimization,"Nabla Zero Labs proposes to continue the development of the Astrodynamics Cloud: A technology enabling the collaborative design, analysis, and optimization of spacecraft trajectories. We aim to support autonomous, integrated, and inter-operable modeling capabilities throughout NASA’s mission portfolio, as well as the rapidly-growing small-satellite industry, where newcomers possess extraordinary hardware capabilities, but more limited astrodynamics and flight mechanics expertise. Our platform is expressly designed to support the next generation of astrodynamics research, which we have called Large-Scale Astrodynamics: a field where the challenges are no longer how to solve one astrodynamical problem, but how to solve thousands or millions, simultaneously, continuously, and in near real-time. All while providing relevant and actionable information to a broad set of stakeholders and ensuring that such information is trustworthy and protected against cyberattacks. During Phase II, we will implement 7 services to be offered through the Astrodynamics Cloud platform: GMAT to solve GMAT-based mission design scenarios; MONTE to encode MONTE-based workflows; CRTBP to analyze trajectories in the cislunar space; SSA to perform large-scale situational awareness calculations; RAPTOR to perform low-thrust trajectory optimization; INTERVALDB an interval-oriented database to manage large-scale trajectory and interval-oriented Big Data; and CHECK a service for validation of trajectories against requirements. We are fortunate that our system comes into existence at a time when our field can barely keep up with the vast number of satellite launches, situational awareness calculations, NASA missions currently in all lifecycle stages, and the ever-increasing pressure of new entrants and stakeholders.

234,High-sensitivity isotopically-purified all-electrical chip-scale atomic magnetometers,"All-electrical chip-scale atomic magnetometers based on spin-coherent transport effects through atomistic defects in semiconductors will have orders of magnitude improved sensitivity if the semiconductor hosts are isotopically purifiedand related device parameters optimized. Current all-electrical chip-scale atomic magnetometers have room-temperature sensitivities ~400 nT/root-Hz, and the proposed innovation we estimate conservatively to provide room-temperature sensitivities of 400 pT/root-Hz with possibilities as low as 100 pT/root-Hz. These are comparable to those achievable with NV-diamond chip-scale atomic magnetometers, but without the requirement for microwave fields or optical elements. These small-scale magnetometers would avoid the need to self-calibrate, compared to fluxgate magnetometers, and avoid challenges related to diffusion of gas through a glass cell and radiation damage of fiberoptics. They would thus be very well suited for nanosats or picosats as their size, power, and complexity restrictions are most severe. Microscopic modeling of the spin-dependent dynamics in SiC-based all-electrical devices will confirm the extreme sensitivity to magnetic fields in isotopically purified SiC. Device simulations of the macroscopic electrical device surrounding this spin-dynamical active region will determine optimal band alignment, electric field distribution, and carrier density profiles. We will design the optimal sensitivity of the magnetometer based on tradeoffs for isotopic purity, regularity of thickness of dielectric and defect occurrence. A Phase II plan will be constructed, identifying the issues related to device growth and fabrication, testing approaches for the near-zero-field magnetoresistance, and integration into magnetometers. Plans will be developed to mitigate issues and partners confirmed for the Phase II project.

235,Intelligent Wireless Fiber Optic Sensor (iWiSe) Network System,"Redondo Optics Inc. (ROI), proposes to design, build, bench and fly test, and deliver to NASA an innovative light weight, small-form-factor, ultra-low power, readily reconfigure intelligent wireless fiber optic sensor (iWiSe™) network system suitable for the remote monitoring of multi-dimensional sensing events – strain, temperature, heat-flow, pressure, vibration, acoustics, ultrasound, etc. – measured by a global network of wireless and self-powered iWiSe™ sensing nodes used to interrogate embedded or surface mounted FBG sensors suitable for operation within the extreme environmental conditions and hard to reach inaccessible locations of large space vehicle rocket propulsion systems. In the Phase I program, ROI will develop a laboratory bench top prototype of the Self-Power Intelligent Wireless iWiSe™ sensor network system to demonstrate its capability to measure static and dynamic sensor data using an iWiSe sensing node interrogating a distributed array of multi-dimensional FBG sensing elements positioned within hard to reach and poorly accessible areas of a space vehicle, and to wirelessly transmit the sensor status data to a remote iWiSe™ data logger receiver/gateway connected via wireless/Ethernet network for global access to NASA’s system condition users (operators, customers, management, etc.). In Phase II of ROI will complete the engineering development, produce, extensively laboratory test, environmentally qualify on a relevant rocket space vehicle-like platform, and deliver to NASA a light weight, space-ready, self-power, intelligent wireless WiSe™ sensor network SHM system.

236,Compact Modular Flash LIDAR,"The need for a space qualified Flash LIDAR that can be configured without significant requalification for Sample Capture, EDL and other GN&C activities has become clear, furthermore improvements is SWaP will enable more applications. To meet the need for a cost effective, compact LIDAR for multiple missions, ASC is proposing to leverage the high TRL design of the OSIRIS-REX LIDAR, but redesign the layout of the electronics and mechanical system into a system architecture that it is easily configurable and significantly more compact. The Ultra-Compact Modular Flash LIDAR (UCML) developed under this effort could be retested for environments to maintain a high TRL so that it can be easily adopted by a wide range of missions with minimal requalification. The redesign would also allow for an interchangeable optics module that can be designed with a mission specific Field of View (FOV). The mechanical system would also be designed to interface with multiple laser modules and be significantly lighter and more compact. Currently ASC is producing lasers for space missions from 0.5 mJ to 18 mJ with wavelengths of 1064nm and 1570nm and has demonstrated energies up to 60mJ. The resulting LIDAR could be as small as 5”x5”x6” and could be configured with lasers up to 60mJ with virtually any FOV(F)Vs of 1 to 180 degrees have been demonstrated). The new LIDAR would be more robust and significantly easier to manufacture reducing cost and schedule risks to future NASA programs

237,"Simple Radiowave-Based Method for Measuring Peripheral Blood Flow
		
			(RFII)","Project objective is to design small radio frequency based flow probes for the measurement of blood flow velocity in peripheral arteries such as the femoral artery and middle cerebral artery. The result will be the technological capability to measure peripheral blood flow rates and flow changes during various environmental stressors such as microgravity without contact to the individual being monitored. This technology may also lead to an easier method of detecting venous gas emboli during extravehicular activities. This technology will be a quantum advance in hemodynamic monitoring and will be applicable in numerous situations such as for immediate assessment and monitoring of patients in life-threatening emergencies, during environmental stressors, and in performance of hazardous occupational tasks. For NASA these benefits will apply to both flight and ground personnel. For the military this device can be used during actual combat to alert medical personnel when a service member is wounded and to monitor his/her condition even before help is provided thus lowering medical evaluation times. This can also be used to aid medical personnel allowing them to prioritize triage and evacuation in multiple casualty contingencies.

238,Rydberg Sensor Laser,"Over the past decade, the Rydberg atom-based RF/microwave sensing technology has emerged as a promising sensing solution for a radar/radio receiver. In the Rydberg-atom-based sensing, highly excited (“Rydberg”) atoms are utilized as antennas, which allows sensitive and SI-traceable detection of RF/microwave fields over a wide frequency range (1 MHz to ~100 GHz) with a single probe. However, one of the major hurdles to wide applications and field deployment of the quantum radar/radio technology is its size, weight, and power (SWaP), mostly from its system overhead (e.g., laser subsystem). In particular, the coupling laser driving the “upper” atomic transition in a two-photon excitation scheme of Rydberg atoms is not well-suited for field applications due to its SWaP and vulnerability to environmental perturbations. Furthermore, coupling lasers do not have a compact frequency reference for laser stabilization. To address the need, Opto-Atomics Corp. (OAC) proposes to develop a Rydberg Sensor Laser (RySL), which will provide a high-power (> 0.5 W), tunable (range > 3 nm) coupling-laser output. One of the main advantages of RySL is that its output is stabilized to a built-in frequency standard, thereby allowing reliable electrometry operation with long-term stability. In addition, RySL design significantly reduces free-space optical components, making the system more compact, reliable, and less sensitive to misalignment and environmental disturbances. In Phase I, OAC will design and assemble key system components of RySL, evaluate their performance, and perform feasibility demonstrations. We will also conduct a preliminary design of the fully-packaged RySL system for future development.

239,High Resolution On-Chip Photonic MKID Spectrometer,"High resolution spectrographs with spectral resolution R = λ/∆λ > 5,000 are one of the most important tools for nearly every discipline in astronomy, but the design of high resolution spectrographs have not experienced significant changes in last several decades. A conventional high resolution spectrograph usually contains a collimator, echelle grating, cross disperser, and finally a camera and science detector—both typically semiconductor detectors. Here we propose developing a spectrometer where the light is separated and channelized by a photonic circuit and is then detected by an energy-resolving superconducting detector. The instrument would be a radical new type of high resolution spectrograph applicable for both multiobject and integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy and other fiber fed light applications. Our goal is to create a high resolution multi-object spectrograph by marrying two breakthrough technologies, ultra-low loss arrayed waveguide gratings (AWG) and Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors, or MKIDs. MKIDs can determine the energy of each arriving photon without read noise or dark current, and with high temporal resolution. The AWG allows us to disperse light from the telescope, in a compact way and to position the dispersed light into numerous output channels which we can conveniently position (i.e. dispersed not just by the angle at which it diffracts off a prism or grating). The MKID allows us to distinguish between the orders in the disperse light contained within the channels, eliminated the need for a cross-disperser. In other words, the energy resolution of the MKID allows us to determine from which echelle order the photon came.

240,Further development and demonstration of S-band Venus Capable Radio Transmitter,"The objective is to develop and demonstrate the feasibility of an S-band communication radio capable of operation at extreme high temperatures and pressures in hostile and corrosive environments. Based on our recent R/R&D success of a 2.385 GHz power amplifier stripline-based microwave integrated circuit (MIC) employing 500C capable SSVDTM, for this Phase I SBIR, we will further address the 500C high temperature survivability of substrate material and associated striplines and circuit components which are also MIC and S-bands compatible. The goal is to realize and achieve an S-band communication receiver and transceiver capable of operation at extreme environments at least to 500C could be built in the Phase II effort. This proposed study directly addresses NASA’s interest and need in expanding the ability to explore deep atmospheres and surfaces of Moon, planets, asteroids, and comets through use of long-lived balloons and landers. The proposed development will ensure that S-band power amplifiers and the associated critical passive circuit components are developed and implemented including the filtering, impedance matching, etc. functions of the MICs. The result and outcome will be a complete S-band integrated communication transceiver that will support extreme temperature operations without additional environmental protection such as special housings in the extreme environments of NASA missions. Although applicable to other missions, we will focus on Venus mission and the requirements for Venus’ surface working condition. This mixer part of this work will also address the manufacturability of the MIC suitable for the Venus environment and ensure the radio to have high integration, high performance, high function, high reliability, small form factor, and low mass.

241,High Speed and High Timing Resolution Cycling Excitation Process (CEP) Sensor Array for NIR LIDAR,"LIDAR detectors are essential for both the spaceborne and airborne systems in many NASA missions. Detectors working at 1064nm wavelength are particularly important to work with YAG-based lasers, the main light source in operation. Therefore, NASA has identified the need of a 1064nm detector with enhanced photon detection efficiency (PDE), low dark noise, and low excess noise. To achieve the goal, Imaging Nanosystems proposes a device that employs the Cycling Excitation Process (CEP), a highly efficient carrier multiplication process to amplify the photocurrent. The device combines (i) a thin layer of disorder material as the CEP gain medium deposited directly on (ii) an InGaAsP light absorption layer, and (iii) using a conduction band offset epitaxial stack to produce the properties of self-quenching and self-recovering, thus saving the need for active quenching circuits. In this Phase I program, we will design a single photon detector based on the analysis of the absorption layer combined with the CEP gain medium by 1D and 2D simulations. The 1D simulation would complete the device structure with all layers, and the 2D analysis would consider the mesa height, field distribution, gain uniformity, and any field-crowding effect which may introduce early breakdown and gain nonuniformity. Additionally, a simple prototype device, integrating the gain medium layer with the light absorption layer, will be designed, fabricated and characterized to demonstrate single photon detection capability and low dark count rate.

242,Beyond Connectivity: Intelligent Object-Oriented Wireless Management,"Increasingly complex and the larger numbers of small spacecraft place ever worsening demands on sensor and avionic subsystem connectivity and integration. At the same time, accelerating spacecraft development schedules mean less time available for fully custom system implementation on every project. Spacecraft system developers and operators need commonality for avionic and sensor subsystem integration. Common components, software, interface specifications support technology reuse, speeding development and testing, lowering costs and significantly improving system reliability. Simultaneously, spacecraft must benefit from the latest wireless communications, sensors, avionics and component technologies. Short-range (i.e. wireless local area networks, WLAN or Wi-Fi) systems have now evolved to support the high level of reliability required by small spacecraft avionics system and sensor interconnectivity. This makes practical wireline to wireless replacement for a large part of spacecraft’s internal and nearby communications requirements. Wireless communications replacing wires is likely to reduce size, weight and power (SWaP); however, more importantly, this change simplifies and adds flexibility to system development and maintenance. Simplification also fosters common interfacing and thereby subsystem component and software reuse. New Wi-Fi systems support higher data rates often exceeding those of legacy wired systems. The ease of adding redundancy to these systems as well improves overall system reliability. Innoflight’s radiation hardened Wi-Fi systems development provides a path to more efficient, reliable and cost effective spacecraft avionics and sensor system implementation.

243,Tailoring the Solar Spectrum for Enhanced Crop Yield for Space Missions,"UbiQD, Inc, has partnered with the University of Arizona, Controlled Environment Agriculture Center, to enhance the lighting component of the Mars-Lunar Greenhouse prototype to improve the food production of the system. Ultimately, the goals are for UbiQD to install a down-conversion film composed of quantum dots (QDs) into a solar collecting/fiber optic system to not only provide higher quality PAR spectrum than currently using, but by converting the high concentration of UV photons to visible photons, UbiQD would be able to dramatically increase the intensity of the PAR spectrum and provided to the plants and the quality of the spectrum will also enhance the efficiency of crop growth. In this Phase II project, we will build on the successful phase I results and develop new light recipes for the QD-films to find the optimal spectra for lettuce and tomatoes, with a final goal to enhance biomass production for controlled environment growing on space missions. The optimal spectrum will be developed by testing different QD light recipes in a custom-built plant growth test stand to quantify biomass production enhancement for lettuce and tomatoes. From the small-scale plant studies, the two leading light recipes for the QD-films will be used in commercial greenhouse studies on lettuce and tomatoes and crop yield improvements will be quantified. The optimal light recipes will also be incorporated into novel fiber-coupled luminescent concentrators (FC-LCs) that can convert sunlight delivered to the MLGH by a solar collector and fiber optic system, to an ideal spectrum for the plants grown in the greenhouse. A portion of the light that is converted by the QDs will be coupled to a second set of fiber optics that can provide inter-canopy lighting to the crops grown. A larger FC-LC prototype will also be developed to be deployed on the surface of the moon or mars and convert and deliver modified sunlight to the greenhouse with fiber optics.

244,Radiation-Resistant High-Resolution Particle Sensors from Composites of Semiconductor Nanoparticles and Aramid Nanofibers,"This SBIR Phase I project will demonstrate that high radiation-resistance can be elicited from nanostructured media comprised of semiconducting nanoparticles derived from size-governed wide band-gap CdTe or PbTe. In order to transform space-based particle sensors, nanocrystalline semiconductors provide an attractive material basis because they present a means of: 1) decreasing the underlying material cost by utilizing a solution-based fabrication methodology, 2) increasing the range of candidate materials by including the narrow-gap semiconductors, 3) increasing the exciton multiplicity upon the impingement of radiation by utilizing multi-exciton generation, and 4) increasing the radiation resistance because the introduction of a high density of nanoparticles can convey pronounced improvement in the radiation hardness of the material. In order to realize these properties, several experimental challenges must be overcome, the surmounting of which is one of the objects of the proposed research, during which we will: 1) utilize self-assembly to realize close-packed quantum-dot domains where the charge transport is optimized, and 2) extend the size of those domains to macroscopic size. The research is designed to not only deliver a high-performance radiation resistant sensor that can be commercialized but it will also advance basic physics by studying the interactions between energetic particles and strongly-confined charge carriers. By finding general material-design methods to suppress both radiation-induced damage and the stochastic thermal loss component in semiconductor materials, one can greatly increase the charge-conversion efficiency, which impacts the resolution of sensing devices, such as the particle detection application targeted, and the energy efficiency of energy harvesting materials, such as those used in solar-cells.

Each of these disciplines provides well-established, cutting-edge tools that accurately combined and fine-tuned for the Fault Management arena will reshape the current FM architecture paradigm. TMC will develop a proof-of-concept SFM system under the inputs and guidance of the NASA Center leading the effort. A representative spacecraft simulator will be identified in order to serve as the ground-truth model and data source. Test scenarios focusing on randomized fault injection will be developed and exercised against the software-only-simulation. The Monte Carlo simulation will be converted into a GPU-accelerated scientific application by exploiting massively parallel computing techniques enabled by the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) general purpose parallel computing architecture of modern NVIDIA GPUs. The large amount of raw diagnostic data, produced by the simulations system bundle (software-only-simulations plus Monte Carlo simulations), will be reduced, analyzed, visualized and modelled using big data mining techniques – a combination of data science concepts and machine learning algorithms – to thoroughly explore the higher-dimensional output space. The results will grant unbiased and unique access to the most influential variable trends, individual design parameters, and specific combinations of parameters that play a critical role in system failures and in the overall fault management behavior of a spacecraft system.

In this project, we will prove the feasibility of using a spectrum-modifying film to improve the quality of light given to a plant, which will lead to more efficient growth and better crop yields. By demonstrating the quality of the light spectrum also plays an important role in growing plants efficiently, UbiQD and the University of Arizona will feel confident in moving on to the next steps of integrating the QD technology into a solar collection device for the Lunar/Mars Greenhouse, and moving closer to designing a plant growth chamber that could be deployed on longer manned space missions. To demonstrate the feasibility that changing the quality of incident light by using a down-converting film will improve lettuce crop yield, two different Ag-Films will be fabricated and used to modify the light spectrum from a Xenon (Xe) lamp system (which best mimics solar irradiation). Then a crop study will be conducted on lettuce crops grown in an indoor hydroponic grow system, where three different sets of lettuce will be grown under the spectrally-modified films. We will also model and estimate the improvement in crop production compared to previous crop production values measured under high pressure sodium lighting in the Mars-Lunar Greenhouse prototype by both utilizing the Ag-film's ability to convert UV light to PAR as well as improving the overall quality of PAR light.

247,High Efficiency Wide Bandwidth Balanced Detector/Preamplifier at 2 Micron Wavelength,"Measuring global winds from space using eye-safe coherent laser radar is an important on-going NASA technology and instrument development effort that will ultimately improve the fidelity of meteorological climate models, near-term weather forecasting, and commercial aviation management and optimization. Activities like NASA LaRC’s “Wind-SP” coherent lidar program are pushing these laser and lidar technologies forward with regard to high-energy eye-safe transmitter lasers, low-noise fast-tunable master and local oscillator lasers, and active optical alignment and lag-angle compensation functionalities specific to space-based applications. Currently critical extended-wavelength (e.g. 2.05 mm sensitive) InGaAs photodiode/photoreceiver technology is mature enough to supply devices necessary for efficient lidar signal capture, but only at lower detection bandwidths that in turn require complicated and expensive photonic solutions to handle the multi-GHz platform-induced Doppler shifts experienced in a low-earth-orbit application. In this Phase I/Phase II effort we propose to push the performance of such coherent lidar signal photoreceivers to a level that would completely eliminate the need for complex master/local oscillator laser offset-locking subsystems that are currently required to compensate for the large frequency offsets from a space platform. This innovation will significantly lower the lidar system complexity, cost, size, weight, and electrical power requirements of future wind lidars from space, greatly improving the flexibility of deployment in terms of feasible launch vehicles and satellite platforms. In Phase I we will work with partner Discovery Semiconductors Inc. to develop and test early prototypes and identify the most appropriate path toward realization of such wideband, high-quantum-efficiency InGaAs devices, and produce optimal devices and associated lower-complexity coherent lidar system architecture in Phase II.

248,Ultraefficient Themoelectric Devices,"Thermoelectric (TE) devices already found a wide range of commercial, military and aerospace applications. However, at present commercially available TE devices typically offer limited heat to electricity conversion efficiencies, well below the fundamental thermodynamic limit, calling for the development of higher efficiency materials. The team of MicroXact Inc., Virginia Tech and Sundew Technologies Inc. is proposing to develop a revolutionary ultrahigh efficiency thermoelectric material fabricated on completely new fabrication principles. The material comprises the three-dimensional ""wells"" of Bi2Te3/Bb2Te3 Quantum Well Superlattices fabricated by a conformal coating of macroporous silicon (MPSi) pore walls. Such a material will provide ZT >2 at macroscopic thicknesses of the material, permitting 15% or more conversion efficiencies. In Phase I of the project the thorough model of the proposed TE material was developed, the achievable efficiency and ZT of the material were confirmed through numerical modeling, and conformal coating of pore walls with Sb2Te3 was experimentally demonstrated, validating the proposed concept. In Phase II the team will fabricate the proposed material and device, and will demonstrate ZT>2 and conversion efficiencies exceeding 15%. After the Phase II MicroXact will commercialize the technology.

249,Space Exploration Extreme Environment Communication Transceiver,"The purpose of this project is to develop and demonstrate an S-band communication radio capable of operation at extreme high temperatures and pressures in hostile and corrosive environments. This directly addresses NASA’s interest in expanding the ability to explore the deep atmospheres and surfaces of the Moon, planets, asteroids, and comets through the use of long-lived (days or weeks) balloons and landers. This will be based on the transmitter that InnoSys has developed based on its proprietary SSVDTM technology, which has been proven to operate at S band and survive a 500 oC environment. Although it could possibly be applied to other missions, we believe Venus mission is a good target for us as it has a dense CO2 atmosphere completely covered by clouds with sulfuric acid aerosols, a surface temperature of 460 to 486ºC, and a surface pressure of 90 atmospheres. As a result, we will call our S band radio a Venus radio to signify our plan to meet Venus’ surface working condition. We expect the proposed S-band radio will support space systems that can operate without additional environmental protection housings in the extreme environments of these NASA missions. InnoSys will also ensure the radio that will be developed to be capable of high reliability, ease of maintenance, small form factor, low mass, and low out-gassing characteristics. For the Phase I study, InnoSys proposes to develop a highly integrated SSVD™-based transmitter design for the Venus radio to be built in the Phase II of this proposed SBIR project. We will perform studies to determine whether SSVDTM or other proven technologies such as the impressive progress made through wide band semiconductor materials by NASA Glenn Center should be used for the receiver design. We will then focus in proper integration to enable essential and critical communications for, for example, between vehicles and probes located on Venus’ surface and systems in orbit around Venus.

250,Extended Short Wave Infrared Focal Plane Array for Versatile Imaging Systems,"Several field applications require extended short wavelength infrared (e-SWIR) band capabilities in future systems. It is highly desirable to design a next-generation FPA to overcome the deficiencies of e-SWIR imaging sensors. In recent years, Antimonide-based Type-II superlattices (T2SL) represent the most promising material system capable of delivering more producible, large-format, reduced pixel pitch, e-SWIR focal plane arrays (FPAs) for global observation applications. We propose to develop T2SL-based photodetectors and FPAs for NASA imaging and spectroscopy applications in the spectral band from visible to extended e-SWIR (0.4–2.5µm) with a very low dark current density. Using the highest quality material and a novel bandgap-engineering design and process, we will fabricate high performance photodetectors and FPAs through the e-SWIR region. In Phase I, we are going to continue to advance our previous work on design and structure of NIR and SWIR T2SL photodetectors and then demonstrate a novel e–SWIR uni-traveling carrier bandstructure–engineered photodetector design utilizing an optimum device structure and material(s) to achieve operation at 150K and above. We will simulate essential electrical and optical characteristics for a device that meets the performance requirements for low dark-current (<1×10-10 A/cm2) and high quantum efficiency (>70%) at 150K. Fabricate and test single element devices as proof of concept for future large format imager suitable for hyperspectral and atmospheric sensing. In this project, Northwestern University will collaborate with Nour, LLC to study and grow strain-balanced InAs1-xSbx/InAs and InAs/AlSb/GaSb Type-II superlattices with barrier structures for e-SWIR photodetectors. Using these superlattice structures, it is expected to achieve longer minority carrier lifetime and lower dark current densities. This will enable reduced imager cooling and significantly reduce size, weight and power of remote observation platforms.

251,High-Bandwidth Photon-Counting Detectors with Enhanced Near-Infrared Response,"Long-range optical telecommunications (LROT) impose challenging requirements on detector array sensitivity at 1064nm and arrays timing bandwidth. Large photonic arrays with integrated beam acquisition, tracking and/or communication capabilities, and smart pixel architecture should allow the implementation of more reliable and robust LROT systems. Integration of smart pixel technology for parallel data acquisition and processing is currently available in silicon. Current silicon photon-counting detector arrays benefit from a worldwide manufacturing and R&D infrastructure but their response at 1064nm is not suitable for LROT. In Phase I we proposed to verify the feasibility of increasing the responsivity of aPeak's silicon photon counting arrays at 1064nm by increasing their quantum absorption efficiency and demonstrating sub-nanosecond timing resolution. Phase I resulted in photon counting arrays with enhanced response at 1064 nm. Modules to be implemented into the readout IC (ROIC) have been fabricated in compact ASIC designs, suitable for integration into the smart pixel fabric they have demonstrated 100ps timing jitter and have exceeded the dynamic range requirements. Noise, timing resolution, and linearity requirements meet updated program requirements Phase II program builds upon Phase I results and previous smart pixel development at aPeak Inc with the aim to develop photon-counting arrays with enhanced 1064nm response and integrated counters at pixel level, capable of high - timing resolution and high counting rate. We propose to develop the photon counting detector arrays, associated ROIC arrays in ASIC, technology to assemble the detector and ROIC arrays, as well as in process ASIC mapping and maskless correction methods critical for the detector fabrication. Detector array design will be improved to meet the detection efficiency at 1064nm, while preserving or improving the detector noise, timing resolution, and linearity demonstrated in Phase I

252,Silicon Carbide Grid Supports for X-Ray Telescopes,"PhotonFoils will develop single crystal silicon carbide grids and membranes for X-ray telescopes and laboratory instruments. SiC grids are needed for microcalorimeter shields on Lynx, which cannot meet design requirements with existing grid materials. SiC grids can also also improve the signal stability of cooled imaging X-ray detectors, such as Lynx HDXI and Axis, by reducing contaminant accumulation in the optical path. NASA requires fine-featured, durable grids as membrane supports for X-ray, EUV, and particle detectors. SiC also offers a path for providing membrane support mesh with superior X-ray transmittance, usable in instruments such as spectrometers, without generating fluorescence artifacts associated with metal grids. The Lynx X-ray Grating Spectrometer will need an Optical Blocking Filter, for which SiC would provide a superior grid. Our proposed SiC grids would provide far superior heat shedding compared to existing grids used for near-solar missions. In addition to grids, our proposed fabrication technology can produce high strength, high bandgap membranes for laboratory X-ray windows, transducers, and transmissive detectors (e.g. X-ray dosimeters and position monitors). These membranes could be used for LWIR filter substrates, or for back-illuminated UV detectors with high collection efficiency. In Phase I we prototyped methods to fabricate single-level SiC grids. In Phase II we will employ these methods to fabricate 2-Level grids, with geometries analogous to the silicon grids used for Hitomi SXS. In Phase II, we will also fabricate SiC membranes, and single-level grids, for various terrestrial and space telescope applications.

253,Autonomously Maintaining Mission Objectives using Fault Management,"Singularity-IA proposes the development of a proof-of-concept software application to design fault detection and mitigation functions into complex systems using modelling, simulation, intelligent design automation, and requirements-based constraints to assist with the design of optimal Fault Management (FM) solutions. FM solutions are an important enabler of autonomous operation. They help reduce operations costs by reducing the number of required monitoring personnel and help increase the chances of success by ensuring a rapid response to faults. NASA’s science program has over 100 spacecraft in operation or development. Many of these platforms are autonomous, or uncrewed, and many other agencies (both government and commercial) around the world are launching spacecraft of their own. The industry for autonomous vehicles is growing rapidly and expected to transform all aspects of travel on the ground, in the air, and in space. FM technologies are necessary to keep people safe and to keep things running. The design process needs to integrate FM concepts from the beginning, and we plan to develop a proof-of-concept tool that makes this easier. Our plan is to replicate an analogous spacecraft power system on a real-world test stand and develop the tools and capability to model and simulate this test stand with various fault conditions. We will use this ability to determine the ideal design to achieve FM objectives, then build a real-world version of the FM system and test it in the real-world power test stand. This approach ties a modelling and simulation capability to a real-world system, which allows us to assess performance of the approach. We will leverage existing tools and capabilities where possible, and add new features where required. Broad simulation testing and intelligent design automation will simplify and accelerate the design process ensuring that engineers can create more reliable and fault tolerant systems in less time than before.

254,Remote UV Fluorescence Lifetime Spectrometer,"The goal of this project is to develop, demonstrate, and deliver to NASA an innovative, portable, and power efficient Remote UV Fluorescence Lifetime Spectrometer (RUVPhaseTM) for the in-situ robotic or manned crew planetary scientific exploration and investigation of surface and subsurface geophysical terrain. The RUVPhaseTM system is based on the integration of ROI's leading technologies: 1) frequency domain fluorescence lifetime-resolved imaging spectroscopy using time gated ""phase-locked"" detection, 2) steady-state fluorescence miniature spectrometer, and 3) remote fiber optic laser induced UV fluorescence detection. The RUVPhaseTM technology addresses the problem of developing a compact, energy efficient, fast detection, and highly sensitive UV Fluorescence Lifetime Spectrometer to remotely detect and measure fluorescence signals from geophysical lunar materials such as minerals and organic species that exhibit characteristic fluorescence signatures in the UV-Visible spectrum with relatively low fluorescence quantum efficiencies. The innovativeness of the miniature RUVPhaseTM system will support a large variety of NASA terrestrial and space scientific discovery applications for chemical and biological materials identification and characterization as well as in the commercial market for medical and biological applications, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, environmental science, and defense and homeland security applications.

255,Additively Manufacture Hyperfine Optomechanical Laser Discipline (AM-HOLD) Module,"Atomic technologies such as atom interferometry, atomic clocks, atomic magnetometers, and Rydberg sensors have demonstrated exquisite stabilities and sensitivities. However, the high complexity, cost, and length development cycles have prevented these technologies from achieving their ultimate value. We propose to use additive manufacturing in combination with microfabricated components, micro optics, and low-noise electronics to rapidly build and assemble atomic devices for atom interferometry applications. Success will be the offering of integrated atomic devices that can be used by NASA, academics, and commercial entities to build compact atomic sensors. This innovation will decrease the Size, Weight, Power, and Cost (SWaP-C) of atomic devices and produce a reliable, high-performance component for stabilizing atom interferometer systems. Atom interferometers are under heavy development using laser cooled atoms in free fall as ultra-precise inertial measurement objects. Enabling this technology can enable ultra-low-bandwidth rate measuring gyroscopes and accelerometers suitable for dead-reckoning deep in space. The NASA Cold Atom Lab (CAL) aboard the International Space Station has used atom interferometry for ultra-precise test of microgravity using absolutely accurate quantum sensing and is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory under the BPS Divison of NASA's Science Mission Directorate. While the underlying technology has been demonstrated, effort in making it manufacturable, repeatable, and reliable is now necessary so that a team of scientists and engineers are not required to operate such advanced devices. This work will enhance the ability for systems to be design, built, and characterized quickly. To develop next-generation atomic sensors, NASA needs reconfigurable, low-power, low-mass atomic devices compatible with off-the-shelf fiber optics and laser systems.

256,"Deep UV Semiconductor Sources for Advanced Planetary Science Instruments, Phase II","This proposal addresses the need for miniature, narrow-linewidth, deep UV optical sources that operate at very low ambient temperatures for use in advanced in situ planetary science instruments for non-contact detection and classification of trace amounts of organic, inorganic, and biogenic materials using Raman and native fluorescence spectroscopic methods.  The sources include aluminum gallium nitride semiconductor lasers and ultra-narrow-linewidth transverse excited hollow cathode lasers emitting between 210 nm to 250 nm, a spectral range with demonstrated higher detection sensitivity and specificity than sources emitting at longer wavelengths.  Applications include non-contact robot-arm or body mounted chemical imaging instruments and detectors for direct analysis of trace levels of chemical species containing C, N, H, O, S, Cl, on surfaces or as extractions from soil, rock, or ice. 	We have achieved the highest recorded deep UV semiconductor internal quantum efficiencies at wavelengths below 250 nm.  But continuing difficulties of attaining laser emission and prospects for narrow line-width compatible with Raman applications has caused us to redirect a significant portion of the Phase II effort to another class of deep UV laser with a more proven UV Raman track record and the potential for miniaturization for robot-arm-mounted applications.

257,Metamorphic Substrate and Fabrication Process for Solar-Blind UV Imaging Arrays,"Imaging in the ultraviolet (UV) is important for heliophysics, astrophysics, exoplanet survey and solar system exploration missions. Many of the currently used UV detectors are sensitive to longer wavelength (i.e. visible) light pollution, and so instruments employ filters to block wavelengths longer than those of interest; however, these filters also attenuate the UV radiation, reducing the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the instrument. Visible wavelengths of light have energies less than the bandgaps of InGaN and AlGaN, and so are not absorbed by them, thus UV detectors based on (In,Al)GaN are insensitive to visible light (i.e. solar blind) and do not require any filters, which increases their EQE. A significant problem preventing AlGaN and InGaN-based UV imaging devices from realizing their true potential is the presence of dislocation defects that result from growing active layers of (In,Al)GaN on lattice-mismatched substrates. The availability of a low-dislocation, lattice-matched virtual substrate would present significant benefits to the availability and performance of (In,Al)GaN UV imaging devices. Other semiconductor technologies make use of lattice-matched virtual substrates that are created by depositing thick buffer layers on a suitable, although lattice-mismatched substrate. This approach fails for (In,Al)GaN because the predominant dislocation types are sessile under biaxial stress and do not glide to interact and reduce their concentration. We propose that nanometer-scale patterning of the substrate (e.g. AlN, GaN, SiC, Si or sapphire) can induce dislocations to glide and reduce in concentration within the buffer layer. The resulting virtual substrate would have a dislocation density low enough to support the fabrication of high-performance (In,Al)GaN transistors and photonic devices.

258,Simplified laser frequency stabilization using spatial-mode interference,"We will demonstrate a laser frequency stabilization technique based on spatial-mode interference that promises reductions in complexity, mass and power consumption compared to the pervasive RF technique. Laser stabilization is an enabling technology for space-based laser interferometers and high-performance laser metrology systems, with applicability to missions such as an optical follow-on to GRACE. Successful demonstration of this technique will simplify laser frequency control in space. The readout technique for ""tilt locking"" has been widely adopted in a range of scientific areas from quantum optics to spectroscopy since first being demonstrated in 1999 [1,2], but it has not been applied to high-performance laser frequency stabilization. Common laser stabilization systems transfer the length stability of an optical reference cavity to the laser frequency (or wavelength) using the standard RF interrogation technique (Pound-Drever Hall (PDH) locking), which employs electro-optic phase modulation of the carrier and RF demodulation as shown in Figure A below. In tilt locking, the reference signal relies instead on interference between overlapping spatial modes on reflection from the cavity, realized simply by intentionally tilting the laser beam and reading out a DC signal level difference between two halves of a two-element photodiode. The use of this DC signal allows the elimination of the phase modulator, RF signal generator and mixer electronics, as shown in Figure B. In addition, the DC operation largely reduces the susceptibility to a commonly limiting noise source: parasitic etalons. To demonstrate tilt-locking as a viable laser frequency stabilization technique we will construct a tilt-locking system comprising a laser, an ultra-stable optical reference cavity in vacuum, along with associated optics and electronics.

259,Rocket and Laboratory Experiments in Astrophysics -- Validation and Verification of the Next Generation FORTIS,"We submit herein a proposal describing plans for further development of a Next Generation Far-UV Off Rowland-circle Telescope for Imaging and Spectroscopy (FORTIS). The goal of the proposal is to demonstrate the scientific utility of multi-object spectroscopy over wide angular fields in the far-UV with investigations of: the blue straggler population in the Globular Cluster M10; low metallicity star formation in the Magellanic Bridge; shock structures Cygnus Loop supernova remnant; a search for unidentified emissions in star-forming galaxies; and potentially an, as yet, unnamed comet as a target of opportunity. FORTIS is a pathfinder for developing the technologies necessary to enable far-UV spectroscopic surveys. Such surveys will allow us to probe problems relevant to the formation of large scale structures, the origin and evolution of galaxies, and the formation and evolution of stars from interstellar gas. In combination with existing and future spectroscopic surveys, they will provide a complete and compelling panchromatic picture of the observable universe. Next generation FORTIS will fly as a sounding rocket borne instrument and incorporate a number of unique technologies, including the Next Generation MicroShutter Array (NGMSA), which provides for the simultaneous acquisition of spectra from multiple objects within a wide angular field. The NGMSA will be controlled by an autonomous targeting system capable of identifying multiple objects on-the-fly for further spectral analysis in the short time afforded to far-UV observations from a sounding rocket ~ 400 seconds. We will also incorporate long life microchannel plate (MCP) detectors that have have high open area ratios, providing for increased quantum efficiency, and improved resistance to gain sag, allowing operation at higher count rate. Recent flight experience with the first generation FORTIS has provided guidance to improving the science return of the next generation FORTIS. Our plans for a rigorous validation and verification of the science and technology is detailed. This program will serve as the basis of doctoral theses for several graduate students in addition to providing hands-on experience with space science missions to a number of undergraduates. It will enable new science thrusts, enabled by new technologies while cultivating new skillsets in the next generation of space scientists.

260,Iodine-Compatible Photocathode for RF Ion Thrusters,"Iodine is highly attractive as an alternate electric propulsion propellant to xenon. It is easily stored in a compact volume on a spacecraft as a solid (greater than twice the storage density than pressurized xenon), which negates the need for a large pressurized tank. This, combined with its low cost and lower ionization energy, make iodine an ideal propellant for a smallsat electric thruster system. Busek currently is developing a line of gridded Radio-Frequency (RF) ion thrusters that utilize iodine as a propellant. In addition to their small size, the thrusters are low power and are compatible with solid-storable propellant iodine. This makes the BIT thruster line a mission-enabling technology for situations where volume and mass are highly constrained. The current generation of BIT thrusters use the BRFC-1, an RF-ion cathode to provide the neutralization current. The BRFC-1 consists of a miniaturized BIT-1 thruster, modified to extract electrons instead of ions. This cathode realization has three main limitations: Power processing complexity, feed system complexity, and reduced system Isp (due to the need to flow propellant to the cathode that does not generate thrust). We propose to develop a photocathode that will produce a current to both ignite and neutralize the Busek line of RF ion thrusters that is highly efficient and iodine compatible. A photocathode emits electrons when struck by an incident light beam. This cathode, when combined with an efficient UV light source, is predicted to significantly decrease the power requirements of the BIT thruster line while drastically improving Isp due to its propellantless operation. The proposed work will measure the quantum efficiency of specially-fabricated photocathodes before and after iodine exposure to evaluate their potential as an RF thruster neutralizer technology.

261,Low-power Broadband Digitizer for Millimeter-Wave Sensor Array Readout,"Multiplexing in frequency domain using a bank of high-Q micro-resonators is an emerging method of reading out large arrays of transition-edge sensors and kinetic-inductance detectors. Low-power digitization of the resultant wide multi-GHz frequency band (e.g., 2-8 GHz) using a broadband superconductor analog-to-digital converter (ADC) enables high fidelity digital readout with immunity from noise, interference and cross-talk. HYPRES, Inc. has recently demonstrated a series of broadband digital radio receivers, built around a fast superconductor ADC. This ADC has low noise, low power, high linear dynamic range, and high radiation resistance. HYPRES proposes to design a similar ADC which is optimized for readout of a frequency-multiplexed sensor array such as that in the MicroSpec far-infrared spectrometer now being developed by NASA GSFC for future space missions. The superconductor ADC can be closely integrated and matched with the cryogenic sensors, enabling both reduction in system power and scaling to large imaging arrays. During Phase I, HYPRES will adapt a phase modulation-demodulation ADC for broadband (8 GHz) input, layout and fabricate an IC combining ADC with digital readout circuitry, and measure ADC performance with RF tones and an RF comb to simulate the frequency-multiplexed output of a sensor array. We will also assess the digital readout system for noise and thermal budget, and design the array interface for Phase II implementation. During Phase II, HYPRES will work with GSFC to integrate the ADC with a system testbed for the MicroSpec spectrometer and demonstrate its performance.

262,UV stable coating for sail-embedded PV power,"SSS Optical Technologies, LLC (SSSOT) together with HBCU Research Institution (RI) Oakwood University (OU) and subcontractor Regher Solar, Inc. (RSI) propose to develop the Polymer Anti-damage Nanocomposite Down-converting Armor (PANDA) coating of solar sail-embedded PV cells that, in addition to blocking UV and ionizing radiation and being UV stable, flexible, and light weight, converts UV into visible radiation that matches the responsivity spectrum of the PV cell. This makes possible to generate extra electricity thus improving the overall PV conversion efficiency by up to 5%. PANDA coating uses a polymer nanocomposite impregnated with UV absorbing luminescent quantum dots (QDs) to shield the coating itself and the coated solar cells from UV radiation and increase PV power conversion efficiency. This is achieved by using spectrum downshifting of solar UV radiation in the QDs to visible radiation. The innovativeness of the technology has three features: (1) UV shielding is combined with the use of the UV energy, otherwise wasted, in the production of additional PV electricity; (2) UV shielding also prevents polymer photodarkening, and (3) solar spectrum conversion from UV to visible-NIR is highly efficient. The overall goal is to develop and demonstrate feasibility of a UV stable coating for sail-embedded solar cells that improve PV power output. To reach the goal, the following technical objectives are identified (1) Design and implement spectrum converting QDs and produce PANDA coatings. (2) Enable UV stability of PANDA and its perforamnce as a protector of solar cells from UV radiation and enhancer of PV conversion efficiency. (3) Conduct experiments on both UV stability and conversion efficiency, analyze experimental data and make conclusions on feasibility of the proposed ideas.

263,Instrument for Airborne Measurement of Carbonyl Sulfide,"Southwest Sciences proposes to develop small, low power instrumentation for the real-time direct measurement of carbonyl sulfide (OCS) in the atmosphere, especially targeting airborne measurements. The instrument will be based on a recently introduced room temperature interband cascade laser (ICL) operating in the 4830 nm region. This laser has a substantially reduced (by a factor of approximately 12) power requirement than quantum cascade lasers operating in the same region and should be better-suited for use in atmospheric field instruments. The Phase I effort will concentrate on characterizing the sensitivity and precision that can be achieved for OCS measurement, using this laser in a laboratory prototype. The Phase I work will also include direct measurement of ambient carbonyl sulfide in the local outside air. The follow-on Phase II project will emphasize development of an airborne-worthy prototype instrument that can be field tested. Carbonyl sulfide is the most abundant naturally occurring sulfur species in the atmosphere, with previous measurements of its concentration yielding results in the range of 500 parts-per-trillion (ppt). The lifetime of OCS in the troposphere is believed to be several years, allowing its transport into the lower stratosphere where it is photochemically oxidized to sulfate particles. Improved understanding of the tropospheric – stratospheric exchange of this important species is needed to gain a better understanding of the role of OCS in sulfate particle production. In turn, the sulfate aerosol layer may significantly influence the earth's energy budget through increased solar scattering. Existing instrumentation for measurement of OCS is bulky and expensive and is complicated by several indirect steps. In contrast, this R&D effort will result in an instrument that measures OCS directly, in real time, with 1-second time response or better.

264,UV/Visible Photon Counting and Imaging Silicon Detectors for Planetary Science Instruments,"We propose to develop photon-counting detectors--including detectors for the ultraviolet spectral range. Planetary science instruments being developed for upcoming New Frontiers, Discovery, SIMPLEx, and flagship missions require photon counting detectors for studying the atmosphere and surface of planetary bodies.   Recent silicon-based photon counting detectors have the potential to enable more compact, higher capability instruments. Quanta Image Sensors (QIS), recently invented at Dartmouth college and currently under development through NASA-SBIR Phase II and other sources by Gigajot offers a new category of solid-state detectors capable of room temperature photon counting. Unlike other solid-state photon counting detectors such as avalanche photodiode arrays (APDs), single photon avalanche photodiode (SPAD) array, and electron multiplying charge coupled devices (EMCCDs) that rely on impact-ionization (avalanche) gain to produce high signal to noise ratio, QIS achieves photon counting at room temperature by having an ultralow noise readout. This structure achieves photon counting with less than five volts. QIS has zero dead time, low dark count, low power, low operating voltage. Because it is fabricated in the latest 3D CMOS image sensor processing, it is easily extendable to various formats and image processing capabilities for planetary cameras, subsystems, and instruments.    We will procure QIS wafers and process ultraviolet photon counting silicon detectors and fully characterize them for photon counting, quantum efficiency, dark current, operating temperature, time-resolved measurements, and read noise. We will evaluate their performance in a side by side comparison with other photon counting ultraviolet detectors such as microchannel plates (MCPs) and EMCCDs in our existing testbeds at JPL and University of Arizona. We will evaluate the radiation tolerance of the QIS architecture by testing them before and after exposure to protons, electrons and gamma rays for total ionization dose and displacement damage. We will rank QIS performance and radiation tolerance and will recommend their further development roadmap and potential use for various environment and applications accordingly.  This technology development will be enabling for planetary instruments by replacing lower QE, high voltage image tube-based detectors and will allow planetary instrument designers, including the proposing team, to select the most suitable detectors from a cadre of high-performance arrays for the space environment and science requirements.

The instrument is based on a room temperature interband cascade laser (ICL) operating in the 4800 - 4900 nm region. This laser has a substantially reduced (by a factor of 40) power requirement compared to quantum cascade lasers operating in the same region and should be better-suited for atmospheric field instruments. Phase I concentrated on characterizing the sensitivity and precision that can be achieved for OCS measurement, using this laser in a laboratory prototype. Phase I also demonstrated direct measurement of ambient carbonyl sulfide in the local outside air, at levels of about 450 parts per trillion. Phase II emphasizes development of an airborne-worthy prototype instrument that can be field tested during the Phase II performance period. Carbonyl sulfide is the most abundant naturally occurring sulfur species in the atmosphere. The lifetime of OCS in the troposphere is believed to be several years, allowing its transport into the lower stratosphere where it is photochemically oxidized to sulfate particles.

266,Angstrom: An Imaging Star Photometer,"Ground-based sun photometers provide a vital consistent global long-term aerosol data record used to better understand aerosol impact on climate, improve aerosol transport models and bound lidar-derived aerosol products. Sun photometers only provide aerosol information during the day, and even though there is scientific and commercial interest, there are very few aerosol measurements made at night. Innovative Imaging and Research proposes Angstrom, an affordable, easily deployable multiband wide field of view (FOV) imaging star photometer that measures aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the Angstrom parameter across the night sky using stars. It can be used to augment traditional sun/lunar photometer networks and significantly improve atmospheric monitoring. Angstrom applies state-of-the-art image processing techniques to imaging systems that use emerging high quantum efficiency, low read noise CMOS sensors and high-quality machine vision optics. Early simulations and test data suggest these imaging systems can acquire dim star fields at a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio. Our goal is to achieve a comparable level of accuracy as gold-standard daytime sun photometers. Imaging star photometers acquire large sky regions measuring near-instantaneous spatial variability not possible with traditional narrow FOV photometers. By imaging multiple stars in a portion of sky covering a wide range of air mass or by continuously imaging stars moving through varying air mass, Angstrom can take advantage of traditional Langley calibration or multi-star methods. Angstrom tracks stars through image processing, eliminating complex precision moving mechanisms. It also uses the relative positions of stars to determine the camera’s orientation, reducing installation and maintenance costs. This allows it to be more easily deployed on ships, UAVs, and fixed terrestrial locations where it has been difficult to obtain measurements.

267,A Single Photon Sensing and Photon Number Resolving Detector for NASA Missions,"The goal of the proposed project is to pave the way for single photon counting gigapixel focal planes through a CMOS detector characterization and redesign program that leverages exciting recent advancements pioneered by the proposing team. The detectors, dubbed the “Quanta Image Sensor,” was recently invented by Co-I Eric Fossum. We expect that device performance will match, or exceed, the performance level of existing state of the art detectors in metrics that are critical for NASA Astrophysics missions. This development program will give scientists extraordinary capabilities, enabling science programs that are not possible today. In the near term, the devices represent an excellent match between delivered performance and requirements for next generation large telescope missions. In addition to having ultra-low noise, they consume low power, are resilient against radiation, and operate as a digital focal plane, relieving many requirements for post-detector electronics. The key feature of the device that enables single photon counting is a high gain pixel design provided by pixels that have very small sense capacitance. The resulting gain per electron is much greater than the noise in the readout circuit. While initial development is for optical detectors, the basic architecture of the proposed technology can be directly extended to UV detectors using proven processes.   The plan of work starts with a short functional characterization program at Dartmouth College using existing devices, followed by an extensive characterization program in the Center for Detectors at the Rochester Institute of Technology. We will measure performance at a large range of cryogenic temperatures in the laboratory, both before and after irradiation in a high energy proton beam, and also at a telescope. We believe that most of the performance characteristics that are relevant for such applications have already been established in this technology, but we will specifically test existing devices, and those with small modifications, for the most extreme demands of space Astrophysics missions. The testing will include read noise, dark current, quantum efficiency, intrapixel sensitivity, persistence, linearity, and radiation testing. We will investigate new data reduction and analysis schemes that are matched to the technology. Based on information from this program, Co-I Fossum will lead an effort to design a new version of the device.  Output products of the proposed activity include simulations, designs, detectors, characterization data, and published papers in conference proceedings and refereed journals.

268,"Fast Light Enhanced Active Gyroscopes, Accelerometers and Fiber- Optic Sensors","The fast-light effect, produced by anomalous dispersion, has emerged as a highly promising mechanism for enhancing the sensitivity of many devices. It is a potentially disruptive technology with the prospect of revolutionizing the field of precision metrology. We will develop this technology in two parallel paths: A rubidium vapor Raman laser-based Active Fast Light Optical Gyroscope/Accelerometer (AFLOGA), and a fiber Brillouin laser based Active Fast Light Fiber-Optic Sensor (AFLIFOS). Both of these systems will be capable of acting as gyroscopes and accelerometers simultaneously. In addition, the AFLIFOS will be a very sensitive sensor for strain and temperature. In final form, the Superluminal Inertial Measurement Units (SIMU) produced with these technologies should be more than four orders of magnitude more sensitive than current state-of-the-art inertial measurement units. In Phase II, we will demonstrate, test, and characterize a laboratory-scale AFLOGA, then use the knowledge gained to design, construct, and test a compact AFLOGA that will fit within a 10 cm by 30 cm by 30 cm case. A design for a complete, six-axis SIMU will be developed with a footprint comparable to commercial inertial measurement units, but with dramatically higher sensitivity. In parallel, we will design, construct, and test a laboratory-scale AFLIFOS system. Finally, a theoretical investigation will be carried out to develop a Master Equation based model for quantum noise limit on the enhancement in sensitivity using a superluminal laser sensor. Northwestern University will serve a subcontractor for this project.

Determine suitability of detector for future Earth science measurements The objective of this project is to demonstrate in space, a new detector with high quantum efficiency and single photon level response at several important remote sensing wavelength detection bands from 0.9 to 4.0 microns. A key element of this demonstration will include the characterization of the detector's response and dark current levels for specific detection periods as a function of exposure time and thus integrated space based radiation dosage. The detector being demonstrated will be a 2 by 8 HgCdTe Avalanche Photo Diode (APD) array developed by DRS -RSTA in Richardson, Texas. The detector will be housed in a small 80K tactical cooler. Currently, there is no space-qualified photon level counting detector at >1-micron which is compatible with long-term space operation. Because a qualified single photon multi-pixel detector was not available at 1 micron, the ICESat-2 mission had to convert its 1-micron laser into the green, which significantly increased the instrument's power and complexity. There are significant NASA needs for photon sensitive IR detector arrays for the ASCENDS, LIST and other planned missions. For this experiment, we will integrate the detector assembly into a 3U cubesat built by the Aerospace Corporation. This will accommodate the DRS device, and will have attitude knowledge and control and ground connectivity similar to the Aerospace cubesats currently operating in space. The experiment only requires the cubesat to point to the ground station and support the detector and cooler operation over short time periods (5 minutes) for multiple missions per week. This mission design significantly simplifies the cubesat hardware design, but provides a long term monitoring of the detector characteristics in a low earth orbit environment. The baseline on-orbit test will use an on-board broad-band optical source integrated with a selectable cubesat flight proven filter mechanism which optically illuminates the detector. We will also endeavor to use the sunlit Earth as another test source and compare the results with multispectral images taken by other Earth observing satellites. A more challenging goal, will involve orienting the cubesat so that it acquires and records laser emissions from our ground station as a one-way lidar to aid in establishing more dynamic operating envelopes for the device compatible with several earth science missions, including LIST, ASCENDS, follow-on ICESat missions, photon-counting laser communications and passive spectrometers in the shortwave to midwave infrared band. To understand radiation exposure details, we will integrate for the first time in a cubesat, the Aerospace dosimeter which was licensed to Teledyne and flew on NASA/LRO, and NASA RBSP-ECT/RPS.

270,High Performance Sealed Tube Cross Strip Photon Counting Sensors for UV-Vis Astrophysics Instruments,"The objective of this program is to exploit the developments in atomic layer deposited (ALD) microchannel plates (MCPs), photocathodes and cross strip (XS) readout techniques to provide a new generation of enhanced performance sealed tube photon counting sensors that span the 115nm to 400nm regime. Efforts in all the subcomponent areas have achieved considerable technical development and heritage, but putting them into a robust integrated package with advanced TRL for the next UV-Vis Astrophysics instruments has not been done to date. Component developments include ALD MCP formats up to 127 x 127 mm with 10 µm pores, background rates of ~0.05 events/cm2/sec, and extended lifetimes to >10 C/cm2. XS anodes and electronics have shown spatial resolutions of <18µm FWHM over formats of 100 x 100mm and event handling rates of 5 MHz at <15% dead time. Photocathodes in the FUV can achieve 50% quantum efficiency at ~115nm and 30% at 200-300nm with cutoffs above 400nm. Combining these developments has a significant impact to potential future NASA sub-orbital and satellite instruments. These advancements will enable high spatial resolution improvements to MCP based spaceflight detectors for imaging and spectroscopic instruments from small to large (>10 cm) formats in the UV to Visible regimes. The smaller pore sizes (~10 µm) and high resolution XS readouts will facilitate higher spatial resolutions over the large formats. At the same time the reduced (÷3) detection efficiency for high-energy background events demonstrated by use of ALD MCPs will also improve observational sensitivities. The chemical compatibility of the new MCP borosilicate glass and the ALD materials has the potential to provide further improvements in the stability and lifetime of these detectors due to the rigorous pre-conditioning steps for sealed tubes. In addition, improvements in fabrication processes provide the opportunity to reduce the imaging fixed pattern modulation and thermal resistance changes. XS readouts integrated into sealed tube packages can also fully take advantage of the efforts currently taking place to establish high performance, spaceflight compatible, low power-mass-volume ASIC readout electronics. These developments will together provide a significant step in the realization of high performance, robust, MCP detectors for the next generations of UV Astrophysics instruments.

271,Next Generation X-ray Polarimeter,"The emission regions of many types of X-ray sources are small and cannot be spatially resolved without interferometry techniques that haven’t yet been developed. In order to understand the emission mechanisms and emission geometry, alternate measurement techniques are required. Most microphysical processes that affect X-rays, including scattering and magnetic emission processes are imprinted as polarization signatures. X-ray polarization also reveals exotic physical processes occurring in regions of very strong gravitational and magnetic fields. Observations of X-ray polarization will provide a measurement of the geometrical distribution of gas and magnetic fields without foreground depolarization that affects longer wavelengths (e.g. Faraday rotation in the radio).   Emission from accretion disks has an inclination-dependent polarization. The polarization signature is modified by extreme gravitational forces, which bend light, essentially changing the contribution of each part of the disk to the integrated total intensity seen by distant observers. Because gravity has the largest effect on the innermost parts of the disk (which are the hottest, and thus contributes to more high energy photons), the energy dependent polarization is diagnostic of disk inclination, black hole mass and spin. Increasing the sensitive energy band will make these measurements possible. X-ray polarimetry will also enable the study of the origin of cosmic rays in the universe, the nature of black holes, the role of black holes in the evolution of galaxies, and the interaction of matter with the highest physically possible magnetic fields. These objectives address NASA's strategic interest in the origin, structure, and evolution of the universe.  We propose a two-year effort to develop the Next Generation X-ray Polarimeter (NGXP) that will have more than ten times the sensitivity of the current state of the art. NGXP will make possible game changing measurements of classes of astrophysical sources that were previously unobtainable within realistic observation times e.g. Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).   Standard photoelectric X-ray polarimeter designs are both quantum efficiency (QE) limited and challenging to calibrate due to diffusion of electron signal as it drifts through the gas. Drifting negative ions decreases diffusion to the thermal limit thereby decoupling sensitivity from drift distance and enabling larger detector areas that can be at the focus of larger diameter mirrors and single reflection concentrator optics. NITPCs also allow the selection of constituent gasses and pressures to be based on the optimization of modulation and QE rather than diffusion properties. This versatility enables a large improvement in sensitivity without driving cost and with only moderate increase to mass and power of the detector and/or instrument. Furthermore, the energy band of NGXP will be tunable to maximize the science return. Following the efforts of this proposal NGXP will be proposed as sounding rocket experiment and as a candidate instrument for future opportunities.  The GSFC polarimeter group has demonstrated NITPCs for several detector concepts. This proposal leverages the previous effort and team expertise with goals to establish the NITPC as the baseline for narrow field observations of faint persistent sources and to improve the technology readiness of associated technologies such as stainless steel gas electron multipliers and finer readout pitch.

272,VIS-NIR Lightweight Spectrometer for the Sun and the Moon,"EPIR Inc. and Brimrose Technology Corporation propose a miniaturized spectrometer covering the 0.35 to 2.3um wavelength range by integrating a Hg1-xCdxTe (MCT) - based photodetector (PD) with an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF). The goal is to achieve 4um spectral resolution with wide dynamic range to measure both the Sun's and the Moon's radiometric characteristics. Currently the best known infrared photon detectors used for spectroscopy are based on MCT. With an adjustable bandgap and little lattice mismatch, MCT photon detectors with high quantum efficiency are sensitive to a very broad spectral range. The proposing company, EPIR, is the leading small business in MCT growth, characterization and focal plane array (FPA) fabrication. The spectroscopic filter is an important component of any spectrometer. Compared with other technologies, e.g. Michelson or Offner interferometers, the proposed AOTF offers high spectral resolution, with the advantages of high speed, programmable waveband selection flexibility, and arbitrary wavelength step size. An AOTF has no moving parts and can be integrated with a MCT photodetector monolithically. The biggest advantage of the proposed spectrometer is its compact system design that reduced size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP), offering significant benefits to the payload as well as in the operation of missions.

273,Flash LIDAR Spatial Resolution and Range Improvements for EDL Applications,"Several up-coming NASA lunar and planetary exploration missions are planning to use state-of-the-art 3D Hazard Detection (HD) and 3D Hazard Relative Navigation techniques to significantly reduce the risks associated with Entry, Decent, and Landing (EDL) operations. 3D Imaging / ranging sensors with improved range, wide-field-of view (WFOV), and instantaneous field-of-view (IFOV) are highly desired to enable the landers to access difficult to reach, science rich landing zones. Global Shutter Flash (GSF) LIDAR has emerged as one of the 3D EDL relative navigation sensors of choice due to its superior real time 3D mapping capabilities. Recent GSF-LIDAR improvements have focused on WFOV and IFOV performance using smaller pixels and larger focal plane array formats. However, smaller pixels degrade LIDAR range performance. Increasing range performance using higher energy lasers is problematic due to the severe size, weight, and power penalties. These SWAP penalties can be avoided by improving the LIDAR detector photo-electrical gain. Range performance is proportional to the square-root of detector photo-optical gain. Existing GSF-LIDARs use InGaAs APD technology. The effective photo-optical gain is the product of the intrinsic quantum efficiency. Typical linear mode InGaAs APD gains range from 1 to 10. Recent advancements in AlxIn1-x AsySb1-y indicate that linear mode photo-optical gains greater than 100 can be achieved with minimal noise degradation. Thus GSF-LIDAR imaging / ranging detectors with improved WFOV, IFOV, and range 1.7X range performance with no additional laser energy requirement. ASC is proposing to develop an AlxIn1-x AsySb1-y detector design optimized for 1064nm operation. In addition, ASC is planning to perform performance measurements on existing AlxIn1-x AsySb1-y 100um single element APDs. Using this information, the focus of the Phase II program is fabricate and evaluate the ranging /imaging 32x32 element GSF-LIDAR focal plane test chip.

274,Electronic Life-detection Instrument for Enceladus/Europa (ELIE),"Background: Widespread synthesis of complex organics, including nucleobases, amino acids, and sugars, occurred early in the history of the solar system, in the solar nebula. These organics were delivered by comets and meteorites to multiple potentially habitable zones (e.g., Earth, Mars, Enceladus, Europa, Titan), which may be targeted by future missions in the search for extant life beyond Earth, e.g., Ocean Worlds. Even in the absence of common ancestry (Panspermia), common building blocks and similar physicochemical environments could have resulted in independent origins of life based on similar biochemistry. We target not only single amino acids (and abundance distribution) but also information-rich biogenic organic molecules: charged linear informational polymers (IPs), enabled by recent advances in solid-state single-molecule nanogap sensors (via quantum electron tunneling, QET). Science Goals: Our mission is to develop an instrument, the Electronic Life-detection Instrument for Enceladus/Europa (ELIE), capable of detecting prebiotic, ancient, or extant life, and distinguishing forward contamination, through detection of two universal biomarkers: the amino acid abundance distribution and IPs. Our instrument will be quite versatile and suitable for a multitude of missions, including lander, rover, subsea explorer, and plume-fly-through missions to Mars, Enceladus, Europa, and other Ocean Worlds. Furthermore, by quantifying forward contamination, our instrument will be able to identify false positives and support planetary protection. Objectives: We will validate single molecule nanogap detection and develop a breadboard system to advance ELIE from technology readiness level (TRL) 2 to TRL 4 and a plan to achieve TRL 6 by the Preliminary Design Review of an Ocean World mission such as Europa Lander or a New Frontiers Enceladus mission. Methodology: An existing nanogap system, already validated on single amino acids, RNA, and DNA, will be used to test first pure solutions, then mixtures of increasing fidelity, such as a protocell and B. subtilis spores in Ocean World analog solutions, prior to validation on environmental analog samples. Comparisons of yield and sensitivity will be made to existing life detection instruments as well as to single molecule sequencing (MinION) and a solid state nanopore, enabled by common low noise amplifier hardware of a proposed TRL 4 system. This system will also integrate a pre-concentration step to target 10 ppt sensitivity for amino acids. Nanogaps have sub-nanometer adjustable gap spacing to accommodate different sizes of molecules. Machine learning methods will be applied to classify biomolecules. The lack of biological reagents supports planetary protection goals by permitting bioburden reduction. Relevance: Our effort specifically responds to multiple aspects of the PICASSO solicitation including ""characterize potential biopolymers,"" ""detect chemical processes indicative of potential life,"" and ""detect ultralow concentrations of microorganisms."" We propose a sensitive and information rich approach to detection of life beyond Earth, suitable for future deployment on multiple missions.

275,Universal Orbital Material Processing Module,"To address NASA need for sustainable space operations and full utilization of the International Space Station (ISS) and specifically to advance the ""Materials, Structures, Mechanical Systems and Manufacturing"" Physical Optics Corporation (POC) proposes to develop a new Universal Orbital Material Processing Module (UniMatPro), an orbital scientific payload that will be capable of optical fiber draw on board ISS. The specific product of this development is ""ZBLAN"", an optical fiber based on a fluoride glass composition. Due to its unique transmission from ultraviolet to midwave infrared, ZBLAN has immediate applications ranging from medical fiber lasers to military airplane countermeasures. ZBLAN glass and glass fibers, when produced on Earth, exhibit excessive insertion loss due to crystallization; however, this crystallization can be suppressed in zero gravity. Low down-mass and the high value of low-loss ZBLAN fiber make it an ideal candidate for commercial ISS utilization. In Phase I POC will design the processing unit for ZBLAN fiber manufacturing on the ISS based on a novel draw process without recoating. We will demonstrate the feasibility of battery-powered wireless operation for a TRL-4 prototype, achieving TRL 6-8 by the end of Phase II, followed by an opportunity to expand the UniMatPro module utilization for processing other prospective materials.

277,Silicon Carbide Grid Fabrication and Vibration Qualification,"SiC grids address identified risks for the Lynx X-ray Microcalorimeter (LXM) and the Athena X-IFU, such as fragility and excessive power usage. Single crystal SiC grids are a natural extension of single crystal Si for integration into NASA filter grids. SiC has the highest thermal conductivity of all materials besides diamond. Phase I measurements showed SiC grids to be 5X stronger than commercial Si grids. We will fabricate prototype SiC X-IFU and LXM microcalorimeter grids with improved temperature uniformity and strength, addressing identified risks for these instruments. We will also improve EMI shielding and develop a method to create custom outer diameters. Each grid will be strength-proofed to ensure design conformance. Full-sized filters incorporating these grids will be durability tested to advance the TRL of SiC grids for NASA missions. All the Phase I objectives were met, with the following results: -An 88mm X-IFU TF4 grid fabricated from a 150mm SiC wafer -Measurements showing high SiC grid strength -Vibration of two 35mm grids to NASA GEVS, one with an attached 80nm membrane -Demonstration of 3:1 grid bar aspect ratio in small grids -A breakout tab method for producing custom outer frame diameters -A test of grid metallization for improved EMI shielding Phase II objectives are to: -Deliver X-IFU TF5 100mm SiC grids with improved temperature uniformity -Deliver 2-Level LXM DMS 128mm SiC grids with improved durability -Vibration test X-IFU 100mm and LXM 2-Level 128mm grids with attached membranes - Develop a durable aluminum coating to increase EMI shielding -Increasing grid bar aspect ratio and reducing minimum grid bar width for 128mm apertures Achieving these objectives will yield a functional spacecraft grid technology providing unparalleled transmittance, strength and temperature uniformity, while meeting EMI requirements.

278,Angstrom: An Imaging Star Photometer,"Ground-based sun photometers provide an important consistent global long-term aerosol data record that is used to better understand aerosol impact on climate, improve aerosol transport models and bound lidar-derived aerosol products. Since sun photometers only provide aerosol information during the day, even though there is scientific interest, there is very little information on aerosols at night. Innovative Imaging and Research proposes Angstrom, an affordable easily deployable multiband wide field of view (FOV) imaging star photometer that measures aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the Angstrom parameter across the night sky using stars. It can be used to augment traditional sun/lunar photometer networks and significantly improve atmospheric monitoring. Angstrom applies state-of-the-art image processing techniques to imaging systems that make use of emerging high quantum efficiency, low read noise CMOS sensors and high-quality machine vision optics. Early simulations and test data suggest these types of imaging systems can acquire dim star fields at a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio to produce traditional sun/lunar photometer AOD and Angstrom parameter measurements using stars instead of the sun or moon. Imaging star photometry acquires large regions of sky and can measure near-instantaneous spatial variability not possible with traditional narrow FOV photometers. By imaging multiple stars in a portion of sky covering a wide range of air mass or by continuously imaging stars moving through varying air mass, Angstrom can take advantage of traditional Langley calibration or multi-star methods. Angstrom tracks stars though image processing, eliminating complex precision moving mechanisms. It also uses the relative positions of stars to determine its orientation simplifying upfront, installation and maintenance costs allowing it to be more easily deployed on ships, UAVs and fixed terrestrial locations where historically it has been difficult to obtain measurements.

280,An Ultra Low Power Cryo-Refrigerator for Space,"Future NASA Space Science Missions will incorporate detectors, sensors, shields, and telescopes that must be cooled to cryogenic temperatures. An enabling technology for these missions is advanced cryocoolers that can provide continuous and distributed cooling with minimal input power. On this program, Creare proposes to develop and demonstrate an innovative cryocooler that produces refrigeration at temperatures of 30 to 70 K and rejects heat at a temperature of 150 to 210 K with extremely high efficiency. The heat rejected can be absorbed by an upper stage cryocooler or rejected to space through a small cryo-radiator. The overall mass of the cryocooler, cryo-radiator and electronics is nominally 6 kg, the area of the cryo-radiator is 0.8 m2 and the input power is significantly less than current state-of-the-art cryocoolers. The electronics utilize parts that are tolerant to 300 kRad total ionizing dose. In addition, the cryocooler technology is extremely reliable and scalable, and produces no perceptible vibration. The key innovation is a cryogenic compressor which has heritage to the cryogenic circulator developed by Creare and operated on the Hubble Space Telescope for 6.5 years. On the Phase I project, we optimized the cryocooler design for a particular mission class and predicted the performance of the cryocooler using a combination of analyses and component-level test data. On the Phase II project, we will build and test a demonstration cryocooler and cryo-radiator. The Phase II testing will be structured to achieve a TRL of at least 5, and will include cryogenic performance and launch vibration testing.

281,Developing Transition Edge Sensors for New Space-Based Applications,"High resolution spectroscopy with thermal detectors shows great promise for making astrophysical discoveries across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio to gamma-rays. These investigations are critical to advancing our understanding of many astrophysical problems related to investigating the structure and evolution of the universe and the origins of the elements, all fundamental NASA goals. Transition Edge Sensor microcalorimeters and bolometers have been highly successful in ground and balloon-based experiments, and technology development is underway to take the next step and operate a TES array in space. Transition Edge Sensors are a versatile and still-developing technology, with applications ranging from astrophysical investigations like the cosmic microwave background and X-ray spectroscopy to potential industrial applications like compact, high resolution X-ray microanalysis instruments. The goal of my investigation is to develop transition edge sensor technology that can be used for a new space-based application, the study of the diffuse soft X-ray background. Diffuse background studies make stringent demands on many different aspects of detector design. Therefore, the new TES technology developed in such an investigation can benefit a variety of applications. With this in mind, my research plan includes learning about space hardware and instrumentation by preparing for a sounding rocket flight that will obtain a high resolution spectrum of the soft X-ray background with a thermistor microcalorimeter array. This will help me build a solid background in instrument science, which I will apply to overcoming the technical challenges associated with building a large-area high energy resolution array of transition edge sensors needed to study the diffuse background.

Proposals are sought that address specific design and development challenges associated with airframe and propulsion systems. These proposals should be linked to improvements in aircraft performance indicators such as vehicle weight, fuel consumption, noise, lift, drag, durability, and emissions."" The technologies of interest to NASA cover five themes. The technology proposed herein falls under the first theme, Fundamental Materials Development, Processing, and Characterization (Topic: A2.01 / Lead Center: GLC). More specifically, the herein proposed work addresses the need for ""new high strength fibers, in particular low density, high strength and stiffness carbon fibers"" that may be utilized in high strength-to-weight ratio composite materials to reduce vehicle weight without compromise to or likely to increase durability. Carbon nanotubes (CNT) have been studied extensively over the past two decades, resulting in a large quantity of fundamental research that has been performed in the areas of synthesis, purification, separation, functionalization, applications development, etc. Their unique properties are expected to bring about a new age of structural and electrical materials. However, one of the primary problems associated with CNT applications development is that all current synthesis techniques produce only short strands of CNT's, typically 10's to 100's of microns long. Therefore, current applications are limited to those that can effectively utilize short CNT strands. The technology proposed herein has the potential to produce continuous, long strands of pure CNT material.

283,"Solid State Large Area Pulsed Solar Simulator for 3-, 4- and 6-Junction Solar Cell Arrays","The Phase I was successful in delivering a complete prototype of the proposed innovation, an LED-based, solid state, large area, pulsed, solar simulator (ssLAPSS). The prototype not only proved the initial concept but significantly reduced risk and dramatically increases our ability to deliver a fully functional ssLAPSS in Phase II. The proposed innovation simulates AM0 response of single, dual, 3, 4, 5 and 6 junction solar cells by using an array of different wavelength LEDs in close proximity to the solar panel string under test. The ssLAPSS is adjustable in spectrum for selected wavelengths and Class A, the highest standard, for spatial uniformity and temporal stability. The ssLAPSS consists of LED modules that are repositioned in a mounting frame to test many strings on a panel in sequence. The ssLAPSS also includes optical sensors so that all metrics can be calibrated and validated automatically. Solar simulation is critical for all solar cell testing, and current large area, pulsed solar simulators will not work for coming 4, 5 and 6 junction technologies. Because the vast majority of NASA missions rely on solar cells, this is critical, enabling test technology for future solar cells. While accurate solar simulation is critical to all solar cell missions, it is particularly important to missions requiring large amounts of power, such as solar electric propulsion (SEP) missions. Beyond NASA's needs, other members of the aerospace community, including prime contractors, solar panel integrators and solar cell manufacturers have a critical need for this capability, which presents excellent commercialization opportunities after the Phase II maturation of the technology.

284,Open|SpeedShop Ease of Use Performance Analysis for Heterogenious Processor Systems,"We propose building upon the modular extensible architecture and existing capabilities of Open|SpeedShop to provide seamless, integrated, heterogeneous processor performance analysis. The NVIDIA GPU and Intel Many Integrated Core (MIC) processors are increasingly important at high performance computing (HPC) laboratories within NASA for use on NASA's high-end computing (HEC) projects because of their ability to accelerate scientific application performance. In order to understand what impact these accelerators are having on performance, tools must succinctly present heterogeneous processor performance information. One of the key goals of this work is to develop and implement innovative methods for presenting the performance information extracted from applications running on both traditional CPU and GPU/MIC processors. Phase II research builds on the progress made in phase I and will include more robust and complete gathering performance information for Intel's MIC architecture. In phase I we built the infrastructure and successfully prototyped a version of Open|SpeedShop that gathered and displayed performance information for applications that ran in the non-offload Intel MIC programming model. For phase II, our research would focus on how to monitor the performance of applications that use Intel's offload programming model.

285,Miniature Photonic Spectrometers and Filters for Astrophysics and Space Science,"This project seeks to apply our recent breakthroughs in astrophotonics - photonics applied to astronomical instrumentation - to replace the large lenses, mirrors, and gratings of conventional astronomical spectrographs with optoelectronic components borrowed from the multi-billion dollar telecommunication industry. This will reduce the mass and volume of these instruments by two to three orders of magnitudes, shorten delivery times, lower the risk, and cut the cost proportionally. Photonic instruments are also more amenable to complex light manipulation and massive multiplexing, cheaper to mass produce, easier to control, much less susceptible to vibrations and flexures, and have higher throughput. The proposed effort directly addresses one of the technology gaps identified in the 2016 Cosmic Origins Technology Report, namely the need to develop ""high-performance spectral dispersion components / devices.""  Using private funding, we have developed photonic near-infrared (1.4 - 1.6 microns) spectrometers where the dispersing optics are replaced by miniature (~1 cubic-centimeter) arrayed waveguide gratings imprinted using buried silicon nitride (``nano-core'') technology, the leading solution for low-loss waveguides. We have also developed highly sophisticated photonics filters using complex waveguide Bragg gratings, produced on the same platform technology as the photonic spectrometers and equally small. These prototypes have been fabricated and tested using the state-of-the-art facilities of the Maryland NanoCenter and AstroPhotonics Lab, and the results of these tests have been published in refereed publications and conference proceedings.   APRA funding is now needed to develop the next generation of photonics spectrometers and filters for astrophysics and space science applications. We will (1) broaden the wavelength range to 1 - 1.7 microns, (2) increase the spectral resolving power of our photonic spectrometers from R ~ 1500 to 3000, (3) experiment with the aspect ratio of the waveguide cross-section and overall design of the Braggs and arrayed waveguide gratings to make them polarization-independent, and (4) increase the overall throughput of these gratings to >70% at 1 - 1.7 microns by changing the deposition method of the cladding material (silica) and reducing the scattering losses with the use of a newly commissioned electron beam writer that delivers higher resolution (down to a few nm instead of ~8 nm). Two graduate students, already trained in the techniques relevant to this project, will lead the optimization, fabrication, and testing of these optoelectronic components. Up to three undergraduate students will also be involved with the research. A wide swath of astrophysical research, from spectroscopic studies of the distant universe to searches for biosignatures in the atmospheres of exoplanets, stands to benefit from these miniature spectrometers and filters on board future NASA balloon, CubeSat, Explorer, Probe-, Flagship-, and Surveyor class missions. The technical by-products of this effort will also offer benefits in fields far beyond astronomy, such as medicine, human science, petrochemistry, space geo-science, and quantum computing and communication.   The names and contact information of five experts qualified to review this proposal were emailed directly to the two relevant Program Officers.

286,Development of far-UV-sensitive silicon imaging arrays for compact UV instrumentation,"Recent advances in the UV responsivity of silicon-based imaging arrays motivate us to develop and test a fully UV-optimized CMOS-detector focal-plane array (FPA) prototype. Notable innovations in silicon-based FPAs have led to the development of detectors with quantum efficiencies at mid-UV wavelengths (200-300 nm) that are competitive with state of the art microchannel plate (MCP) technology (e.g., Bai et al., SPIE, 2008; Nikzad et al., 2011) with the added advantage that, unlike MCPs, they do not require high-voltage power supplies. Hence, the utilization of these innovative detectors in future UV spectrographs or imagers will reduce the power, mass and complexity of such instruments over their current equivalents, making them well-suited for future low-cost planetary missions including those based on CubeSats and other SmallSat platforms. In previous studies we characterized the far-UV (100-200 nm) performance of UV-optimized n-type silicon devices at SwRI (Davis et al, SPIE 2012) and began to develop methods of enhancing the far-UV response by doping thinned-silicon wafers with antimony using Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) (Retherford et al., JATIS, 2015).  This work demonstrated that the MBE process is feasible for silicon wafers with thicknesses as little as 100 microns; an important result, given the short absorption depth of far-UV photons in silicon. Methods of cleaning the wafers prior to MBE were investigated at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, and the MBE process was optimized through a series of experiments in which the target doping concentrations, growth temperatures and epitaxial-silicon thicknesses were varied. Exploiting this initial success, we intend to (1) complete the optimization of the MBE process for n-type backside-illuminated CMOS hybrid arrays from Teledyne, (2) expand the assessment to include MBE process on state-of-the-art p-type CMOS monolithic arrays made using ~10-micron epitaxial-wafers from Teledyne e2v, and investigate options for anti-reflectance coatings to reject longer wavelength light, and (3) fabricate and test UV-optimized photodiodes, analyzing their response to wavelengths from far UV to the visible. We will also develop a full prototype FUV-optimized CMOS FPA taking advantage of flight-heritage array formats such as HAWAII-1RG.  For the component technologies developed in this program, the entrance TRL of 3 will be raised to TRL 4 or higher upon exiting the program.  Once developed, these UV-optimized devices will enable highly capable SmallSat investigations of lunar polar volatiles, Venusian upper atmosphere composition and dynamics, water vapor plumes at Enceladus and/or Europa, and other targeted science measurements detailed within the Vision and Voyages Planetary Decadal Survey.

287,"Lightweight, Radiation Resistant, Low Tg, Thoraeus Rubber Inflatable Space Habitats","NanoSonic's Shape Memory Metal RubberTM (SM-MR) exhibits reconfigurable and recoverable changes in structural and RF properties as it can be mechanically and repeatedly inflated without loss of EMI shielding (-88dB). In support of NASA's goals for a robust space exploration program, it is anticipated that NanoSonic's lightweight low permeable bladders shall also exhibit long term radiation resistance upon morphing; a property that few, if any, inflatable materials offer. Typical highly filled or metal evaporated nanocomposites crack upon flexing. Conformal and compliant SM-MR is based on self-assembled high-z, dense, nanoparticles covalently bound to ultra-low glass transition temperature (as low as -145C, 128 Kelvin) elastomeric or shape memory polymers. NanoSonic and our STTR partner, Colorado State University, have demonstrated that SM-MR is up to 50% lighter in weight and provides greater gamma ray attenuation relative to commercial shielding materials, without emitting harmful secondary radiation under a 137Cs source. During Phase I, low temperature flexibility, and radiation/micrometeorite (lunar dust) resistance would be verified under simulated Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR) conditions, using gamma radiation sources and an electron accelerator with uniform beams up to 20 MeV. TRL9 shall be reached with our space systems partner upon infusion of Thoraeus RubberTM onto NASA habitats.

288,High Average Power Fiber Laser for Satellite Communications,"Very high average power lasers with high electrical-top-optical (E-O) efficiency, which also support pulse position modulation (PPM) formats in the MHz-data rate speeds, do not currently exist. Solid-state lasers fail to provide the necessary E-O requirements due to low quantum efficiency and excess heat generation. MHz-speed modulation formats are not supported by fiber lasers at very high average powers due to nonlinearities. These nonlinearities cause instabilities in the output power, and also cause the optical spectrum to exceed the system requirements. A very high power, short pulse fiber laser is proposed which can operate in two modes of operation; a targeting/beacon mode, and a data transmit mode. The very high average powers are achieved by filling the time-slot of a PPM format scheme with a high-duty-cycle sequence of much shorter pulses. This allows the nonlinearities in the fiber laser to be mitigated and allow very high average powers within the required bandwidth spectrum. A seed laser which emits picosecond pulses will be driven by electronics to provide a very high duty cycle modulated by a slower modulation envelope to allow for PPM data transmission. The very high duty cycle will allow the average power to increase while keeping the peak powers low through a series of Yb-doped fiber amplifiers. A factor of two is targeted between the peak and average powers. The fiber amplifiers will used highly doped Yb-doped fibers in order to keep the fiber lengths to a minimum, which minimizes nonlinear effects such as stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), and self-phase modulation (SPM). The modulation format to support the targeting/beacon mode will be accomplished by turning the final fiber amplifier(s) on/off. This is possible due to the upper state lifetime of the Yb ions in the fiber amplifiers.

289,"Radiation Resistant, Reconfigurable, Shape Memory Metal Rubber Space Arrays","NanoSonic has demonstrated that Shape Memory Metal RubberTM (SM-MR) adaptive skins exhibit reconfigurable and durable RF properties. It is hypothesized that such morphing skins shall also exhibit durable radiation resistance upon morphing; a property that few, if any, flexible materials offer. Typical highly filled or metal evaporated nanocomposites crack and spall upon flexation, and cannot be repeatedly mechanically stretched without rupture after a few cyclic strains. SM-MR nanostructured morphing materials are based on self-assembled high z, dense, Au and Ag nanoparticles, rather than Pb. Our manufacturing process yields tough skins that can be repeatedly and severely mechanically morphed without loss of EMI shielding (-88dB). NanoSonic, together with Colorado State University, have demonstrated that SM-MR is up to 50% lighter in weight and provides greater gamma ray attenuation relative to commercial off-the-shelf shielding materials, without emitting harmful secondary radiation under a 137Cs source. During Phase I, radiation shielding would be verified for SM-MR during potential disparate space array morphed configurations to demonstrate durability, stowability, and reconfigurability for space tolerant structures with self-healing properties to reach TRL6. TRL8 and 9 shall be reached during Phase II and III with assistance from our space systems prime partner upon flight testing and integration.

290,High Hydrogen Thoraeus Rubber Gossamer Radiation Shielding for Human Protection,"NanoSonic has recently developed ultra-lightweight, durable, high hydrogen containing Thoraeus Rubber™ nanocomposites that may serve as radiation protection for space transportation vehicles as well as astronauts against DNA damaging high-energy particles and ionizing radiation. Thoraeus Rubber maximizes shielding with minimum bulk by grading alternating high and low atomic number (Z) nanoparticles within an energy dissipating hydrogenous neutron shielding polymer network to slow high-energy neutron elastic collisions and absorb resultant gamma rays, X-rays and high-energy particles. For comparable mass and areal densities, Thoraeus Rubber attenuates twice the level of gamma radiation under a 137Cs source relative to the COTS product and Ta at one-fourth the mass density, and with zero secondary ionization. The TRL of Thoraeus Rubber shall be increased from 3 - 5 via measurements at Brookhaven Radiation Effects Facility through our radiation expert and Certified Health Physicist partner at Colorado State University (CSU). TRL 7 shall be reached during Phase II upon space habitat construction and flight-testing with our space prime partners. TRL 9 shall be attained upon demonstration of Thoraeus Rubber on space vehicles traveling with humans through low Earth orbit (LEO), geosynchronous orbit, Moon, Mars, and the Asteroids that enable NASA's Human Exploration goals.

291,"Innovative, Lightweight Thoraeus RubberTM for MMOD and Space Radiation Shielding","NanoSonic offers an innovative manufacturing process to yield ultra-lightweight radiation shielding nanocomposites by exploiting the concept of the Thoraeus filter on the nanoscale. Our elegant, layer-by-layer deposition process allows for unique layering with molecular level precision to covalently bind advanced polymers with alternating layers of high and low z nanoparticles. While radiation shielding cannot be achieved without some combination of mass density and appropriate choice of materials, NanoSonic's Thoraeus Rubber™ are nanostructured layers engineered in a manner to maximize shielding with minimum bulk within a hydrogenous network to address neutron emissions in addition to RF, gamma, X-ray and high energy particles. Radiation shielding shall be evaluated at Colorado State University and the Brookhaven Radiation Effects Facility to verify protection for humans and exploration vehicles envisioned for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and long-duration missions beyond LEO. Thermal, mechanical, and RF characterization would be carried out at NanoSonic. Micrometeoroids and Orbital Debris (MMOD) resistance and outgassing would be carried out by our space prime partner. Candidate materials shall be delivered in support of demonstration experiments for Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE). TRL 8-9 would be achieved upon demonstration of human and electronics protection from long-duration galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) and solar energetic particles (SEP).

292,Terahertz Laboratory Spectroscopy of Iron Hydride Species FeH and FeH+,"Iron plays an important role in astrophysics. Having the one of the most stable binding energies of any element, it ranks 9th in overall cosmic abundance, with Fe/H ~ 3×10-5. It is sufficiently prevalent to be routinely used as a measure of metallicity in stars from its optical transitions. In the diffuse interstellar medium, iron appears to be depleted in the gas-phase by one to two orders of magnitude, based on ultraviolet absorption lines, suggesting that the element is incorporated into dust grains. The common occurrence of iron in meteorites and pre-solar grains bolsters this concept. On the other hand, type Ia supernovae, an major source of iron, show no evidence of dust grains in their ejecta. This result suggests that a large portion of iron remains in the gas phase. Some fraction of this gas-phase iron could be in molecular form. FeH and its corresponding ion, FeH+, are excellent molecular candidates, given the abundance of interstellar hydrogen. FeH itself has also been observed in the atmospheres of M-type stars and L-type brown dwarfs via electronic transitions in the near-infrared. However, probably the best technique for studying FeH and FeH+ in the general interstellar medium is via the pure rotational transitions of these species, which, because they are hydrides, only occur at sub-mm/THz/infrared wavelengths, and are often inaccessible by ground-based telescopes.  Therefore, FeH and FeH+ are extremely good targets for sub-mm/THz NASA missions. The purpose of this proposal is to assemble a complete database of directly measured, highly accurate (1 part in 107) rotational rest frequencies for FeH, its deuterium isotopologue FeD, and its ionic forms FeH+ and FeD+ in the frequency range 0.5 – 2 THz.  Such a data set does not exist for either species, in part because spectroscopy of these molecules is not trivial. FeH has a highly perturbed, 4Δi ground electronic state, which precludes prediction of the THz rest frequencies from known infrared constants. There is no spectroscopic data of any sort for FeH+, and even its ground electronic state is uncertain, although theory suggests it is 5Δi.  This project is well-matched to the PI's extensive experience in measuring and analyzing the spectra of iron-bearing molecules with exotic ground states, including those with perturbations (e.g. FeC (X3Δi), FeO (X5Δi),  FeN (X2Δi), FeCN, (X4Δi), FeNC (X4Δi), FeO+ (X6Σ+)).  Furthermore, the PI and her group already have preliminary measurements of a few sub-mm transitions of FeH and FeD, and thus the success of future work is highly probable. The technique to be employed for the measurements is sub-mm/THz direct absorption spectroscopy. Three working, proven spectrometers are available for this work, and the PI has already developed the unusual gas-phase synthetic techniques necessary to create these unstable species, and the spectroscopic expertise to analyze their open-shell electronic states. In addition, highly accurate quantum chemical calculations will be performed for FeH and FeH+ to provide additional molecular properties (dipole moments, line strengths), as well as assist in predicting the ground electronic state of the ion. Observations conducted in the past with Herschel Space Observatory and currently, SOFIA, have clearly demonstrated that simple hydride molecules such as NH, CH+, HF, SH+, HCl+, and OH+ are common constituents of many regions of the interstellar medium, even those with a rare element such as F or Cl. Moreover, other iron-containing molecules have been observed in circumstellar gas (FeCN in the outer envelope of the late-type carbon star IRC+10216) and possibly in dense molecular clouds (FeO in Sgr B2(M)).  It would seem feasible that other Fe-bearing species would be present in interstellar gas. Hydrides have long been considered the building blocks of astrochemistry.

293,"Ultra-Compact Optical Spectrometer for Organic Mapping, uCOSOM (microcosm)","We propose to develop a soda-can-size, 500 g, 400 mW instrument for mounting on small lander or rover arms: the ultra-Compact Optical Spectrometer for Organic Mapping (uCOSOM) instrument. Two core technologies enable the proposed instrument: a narrow linewidth deep UV laser and a new uncooled, resistive gate linear DUV CCD array detector with high quantum efficiency in the DUV with fast read rates and low read noise. The need for in situ micro-scale mapping for trace concentrations of organics on planetary surfaces is exemplified by requirements put forth the (July 09) Mid Range Rover; Science Analysis Group (MRR-SAG) and again in a 2010 Astrobiology paper by Pratt et al. uCOSOM fulfills similar organic needs on future in-situ missions with MER class rover/arm sizes or small landers to planetary bodies such as Mars, icy worlds (Titan, Europa, Enceladus), and small primitive bodies. uCOSOM provides a broad organic and inorganic compound measurement capability without the need for sample handling or reagents. It will excite sub-ppb levels of organic compounds on rocks, soil, or other surfaces in the deep UV below 250 nm and simultaneously measure Raman scattering in the 250 nm to 260 nm region (1000 to 4000 cm-1) and native fluorescence in the 260 nm to 700 nm region at a working distance of several cm, with long depth of focus, and with the ability to map areas up to 1 by 1 cm in size with 100 micrometer spatial resolution. The pulsed source enables solar blind gated Raman and fluorescence spectral measurements but also fluorescence and phosphorescence decay measurements to provide orthogonal information about target composition. The instrument can also provide spectral reflectance of targets from 250 nm to 700 nm together with Raman and fluorescence data, using solar illumination, and enable solar and stellar irradiance and sky background measurements.

294,Faint Intergalactic Redshifted Emission Balloon (FIREBALL)-2: Flight Test of Next Generation UV Detector and Spectrograph (Co-I Proposal),"Columbia University is a Co-I institution in a collaborative research program with Caltech, the Lead Institution (PI: Christopher Martin). We have developed and successfully flown a path-finding experiment, the Faint Intergalactic-medium Redshifted Emission Balloon (FIREBALL), designed to discover and map faint emission from the Intergalactic Medium (IGM). Our successful science flight in June 2009, proved every aspect of the complex instrument performance, and provided the strongest measurements and constraints on IGM emission available from any instrument. We are preparing a significantly upgraded experiment, FIREBALL-2, for launch in Fall 2015 at Ft. Sumner, New Mexico. We have made progress in spectrograph, detector, and payload design and development. CNES is providing the spectrograph, gondola, and gondola flight support team. Because of a CNES balloon mishap and funding constraints, support for a FIREBALL launch was delayed from Fall 2013 to Fall 2015. We propose 18 months of bridge funding to support the FIREBALL team that includes one woman Ph.D. student at Columbia University.  FIREBALL directly supports NASA Science Plan Objectives to ""Understand the many phenomena and processes associated with galaxy, stellar, and planetary system formation and evolution from the earliest epochs to today."" FIREBALL directly addresses four Core Science Questions from the Astrophysics 2010 Decadal Survey (New Worlds New Horizons). FIREBALL provides flight and science testing of new UV technologies directly called out by NWNH as high priority for the next decade as a precursor to a 4-m class UV/optical future mission.   STATUS COMPARED TO 2011 PROPOSAL GOALS.   Our proposal in 2011 proposed a relatively simple modification to the FIREBALL-1 payload, replacement of the fiber integral field unit with a multi-bundle fiber interface, and replacement of the GALEX spare NUV detector with a Gen-2, high quantum efficiency UV photon-counting CCD. The modest scale of these changes allowed us to propose a Spring 2013 launch. The accepted proposal and delayed funding profile led to a slip in the launch of one year to Spring 2014.  Further evaluation of the science requirements for the spectrograph, observational progress by our group at higher redshift, and strategic development of future multiplexed UV spectrometers led us to significantly redesign the FIREBALL-2 payload. We are implementing a multi-slit spectrograph optimized for detecting circum-galactic medium emission around galaxies at a red-shift near 0.7 (using LYα), 0.36 (using CIV), 1.0 (using OVI), or 0.28 (using HeII 1640Å). At the same time the CNES balloon group had a flight mishap that along with budget constraints, along with a decision by CSBF to only support Fall turn-around flights, has delayed the launch from Spring 2014 to a Fall 2015 from Ft. Sumner.   We have made significant progress in the payload design and development and on the Gen-2 detector. Key features of the new design include higher angular resolution (improved from 10 arcsec to 5 arcsec) in order to separate galaxy from CGM emission more definitively; a field corrector to provide high resolution images over a 30 arcmin field; a new multi-mask multislit unit with slit masks selectable during flight; a fast, wide field Schmidt spectrograph; a windowless spectrograph/detector design which minimizes Cerenkov background; a flight detector cryocooler that will be a pathfinder for satellite detector cooling systems; spectrograph field rotation compensation; a new gondola pointing system that will provide significantly improved pointing control (from 6 arcsec to 2 arcsec).   This proposal provides 18 months of additional funding to complete payload integration, support field operations for a single flight, and provide 9 months of post-flight support for data analysis and science publication.

296,Q-Thruster Breadboard Campaign,"JSC's Dr. Harold ""Sonny"" White has developed the physics theory basis for utilizing the quantum vacuum to produce thrust. The engineering implementation of the theory is known as Q-thruster. During FY13, three test campaigns were conducted that conclusively demonstrated tangible evidence of Q-thruster physics with measurable thrust bringing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) from TRL 2 to early TRL 3. This project will continue with the development of the technology to a breadboard level by leveraging the most recent NASA/industry test hardware. This project will replace the manual tuning process used in the 2013 test campaign with an automated Radio Frequency (RF) Phase Lock Loop system (precursor to flight-like implementation), and will redesign the signal ports to minimize RF leakage (improves efficiency). This project will build on the 2013 test campaign using the above improvements on the test implementation to get ready for subsequent Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) testing at Glenn Research Center (GRC) and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in FY 2015. Q-thruster technology has a much higher thrust to power than current forms of electric propulsion (~7x Hall thrusters), and can significantly reduce the total power required for either Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) or Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP). Also, due to the high thrust and high specific impulse, Q-thruster technology will greatly relax the specific mass requirements for in-space nuclear reactor systems. Q-thrusters can reduce transit times for a power-constrained architecture. Q-thruster technology is a mission enabling form of electric propulsion and is already being traded by NASA's Concept Architecture Team (CAT) & Human Space Flight (HSF) Architecture Team (HAT) as an electric propulsion effector for Asteroid Recovery Vehicle (ARV) mission extensibility options out to Mars. The Nuclear Electric Propulsion mission allows for rapid transit while allowing for a heavy, more near-term reactor design and the Solar Electric Propulsion mission allows for a power starved approach with similar mission durations to Design Reference Architecture - DRA 5.0 that would not be possible without the Q-thruster technology.

297,"An LED-Based, Laboratory-Scale Solar Simulator for Advanced 3, 4, 5 & 6 Junction Space Photovoltaic Power Systems","As a result of significant technical effort, the Phase I was successful in delivering a solar simulator prototype that not only proved the initial concept but will significantly reduce future risk and increase our ability to deliver a fully-functional solar simulator in Phase II. The proposed innovation is an LED-based, laboratory-scale, solar simulator. The proposed innovation simulates AM0 response of single, dual, 3, 4, 5 and 6 junction solar cells by using an array of different wavelength LEDs in close proximity to the cell under test. The simulator is adjustable in spectral matching for selected wavelengths and Class A, the highest standard, for spatial uniformity and temporal stability. The solar simulator illuminates a square area 10 inches by 10 inches and includes optical sensors so that all metrics can be calibrated and validated automatically as needed. Solar simulation is critical for all solar cell testing, and current simulators will not work for coming 4, 5 and 6 junction technologies. Because the vast majority of NASA missions rely on solar cells, this is critical, enabling test technology for future solar cells. While accurate solar simulation is critical to all solar cell missions, it is particularly important to missions requiring large amounts of power, such as solar electric propulsion (SEP) missions. Beyond NASA's needs, other members of the aerospace community, including solar cell manufacturers, test labs and research institutions, have a critical need for this capability which presents excellent commercialization opportunities after the Phase II maturation of the technology.

298,Networked ATM for Efficient Routing,"Uncertainties in weather forecasts and traffic congestion sometimes result in inefficient planned flight paths for aircraft operating in the National Airspace System (NAS). Over the past several years, NASA developed two decision support tools to identify opportunities for efficient re-routes. The Dynamic Weather Routing (DWR) system uses information generated on the ground to identify candidate flights for re-routing and the airline operations center (AOC) sends the proposed change to the flight deck for subsequent negotiation with air traffic control (ATC). The Traffic Aware Strategic Aircrew Requests (TASAR) system is flight deck-based, using information available on the aircraft and software in the electronic flight bag (EFB) to suggest alternative routes. DWR successfully completed operational tests at ZFW and American Airlines and TASAR will soon begin operational evaluations at Alaska Airlines and Virgin America. Our concept proposes a more capable architecture that can take full advantage of emerging communications technologies to integrate AOC and flight deck capabilities. This approach offers a more robust, extensible architecture that can be tailored to an individual airline's operational model while simultaneously offering an upgrade path for adding more capability over time. Our solution aims to combine the best features of DWR and TASAR and adds more capability via enhanced data communications. Our solution fully integrates with the AOC but retains full access to the superior information from the flight deck. This enables our architecture to use the best available data, allocate data processing and analytical functions to where they can be performed most efficiently, and allows the airline to choose where it wants decision making to occur.

299,Gravitational Physics via Millimeter Accuracy Data from APOLLO,"Gravity--the most evident force of nature--is in fact the weakest of the fundamental forces, and consequently the most poorly tested. Einstein's general relativity, currently our best description of gravity, is fundamentally incompatible with quantum mechanics and is likely not the final word on gravity. A modified theory would predict small solar system deviations that could have profound consequences for our understanding of the Universe as a whole. Lunar laser ranging (LLR), in which short laser pulses launched from a telescope are bounced off of reflectors placed on the moon by U.S. astronauts and Soviet landers, has for decades produced some of the leading tests of gravity by mapping the shape of the lunar orbit to high precision. Since 2006, an experiment called APOLLO (the Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation) has been collecting the best LLR data in the world, in terms of both data volume and precision. In the last year, we have added the capability to guarantee accuracy of APOLLO data at the millimeter level. We propose a campaign to collect the first-ever set of millimeter-accurate LLR data using APOLLO.  Lunar ranging provides the best tests of a number of gravitational phenomenologies, including tests of the strong equivalence principle, the time-rate-of-change of Newton's gravitational constant, gravitomagnetism, the inverse-square law, and many others. The improvements made possible by APOLLO will either expose new physics or establish more stringent constraints on the foundation of gravity. Besides its data quality, APOLLO's ability to range to all five lunar reflectors on timescales of much less than one hour dramatically improves our ability to gauge the orientation and distortion of the Moon. This information produces insights into the interior structure and dynamics of the Moon--itself allowing a more precise determination of the path for the center of the Moon, which is needed for fundamental tests of gravity. Similarly, high-accuracy range measurements, together with data from a superconducting gravimeter at the Apache Point Observatory and from a high-quality Global Positioning System (GPS) station 2.5 km away, will greatly improve our understanding of the instantaneous location of the Observatory with respect to the Earth's center of mass (needed for the gravitational test) by exposing subtle Earth dynamics that must be incorporated into the model.  In addition to dramatic improvements in the classical gravitational tests listed above, APOLLO will permit exploration of new ideas in physics relating to dark energy, extra dimensions, and violations of Lorentz Invariance: very much in line with NASA's mandate to discover how the Universe works.  The proposed work will benefit the broader community in a number of ways. On the intellectual front, improving our knowledge of gravity informs a diverse range of cosmologists, astrophysicists, particle physicists, and string theorists. The effort would also contribute to Earth and planetary science, especially via the inclusion of the superconducting gravimeter data.  APOLLO will continue its strong record supporting undergraduate and graduate researchers, including women and minorities.  The proposal includes support for two graduate students and for undergraduate research. The investigators routinely engage in outreach activities associated with the programs Reach for Tomorrow, Tech Trek, and the Annenberg Foundation's Physics of the 21st Century. These programs target underprivileged middle school kids, middle school girls who show scientific interest, and high school teachers, respectively.  APOLLO has been effective at public outreach and education via news articles, magazine articles, radio interviews, and appearances on popular television shows. This level of media attention should continue into the future, given the appealing combination of tests of Einstein's gravity, the legendary lunar landings, and remarkable technology.

300,"Low-Loss, Low-Noise, Crystalline and Amorphous Silicon Dielectrics for Superconducting Microstriplines and Kinetic Inductance Detector Capacitors","Prospective future PCOS (Inflation Probe) and COR (Origins Space Telescope, FIR Interferometer) missions require large arrays of highly sensitive millimeter-wave and submillimeter (mm/submm) detectors, including spectroscopic detectors. A number of technology developments in superconducting sensors for these applications require low-loss dielectric thin films. Examples include:  Microstrip-coupled superconducting mm/submm detectors, which rely on superconductor-dielectric-superconductor microstrip transmission line to transmit optical power from a coherent reception element (feed horn, lens coupled antenna, phased-array antenna) to detectors;  Superconducting spectrometers (SuperSpec, TIME, MicroSpec), which use such microstrip to route optical power to detectors and to define spectral channels;  Kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs), which use capacitors.   In the above, the dielectric loss, quantified by the loss tangent (tan delta), is critical: it determines the optical loss in the microstrip, the resolution of spectral channels, and the two-level-system (TLS) dielectric fluctuation noise of the KID capacitor. Currently, the amorphous dielectrics SiO2 and SiNx are used because they are most convenient for fabrication. They have tan delta ~ 1e-3.  This loss tangent is acceptable for microstripline but severely limits the possible architectures and spectral resolving power, and it is too large for KID capacitors.  Lower loss dielectric would result in a quantum leap in capability, opening up design space heretofore inaccessible and enabling design innovations.  Specific impacts on the above technologies would be:   For phased-array antennas, lower optical loss would allow the detectors to be moved away from the antenna, allowing them to be shielded from absorption of light that has not been spatially or spectrally filtered and also obviating long wiring busses. More sophisticated antenna designs, such as multiscale antennas  covering a decade of spectral bandwidth, could be entertained;  For superconducting spectrometers, lower loss would improve the spectral resolution limit, Rmax = (1/tan delta), from 1e3 to 2e5, sufficient for resolved extragalactic mm/submm spectroscopy, where intrinsic line widths are dnu/nu ~ 1e-4 to 1e-3;  For KIDs, the interdigitated capacitors (IDC) currently used could be replaced by parallel-plate capacitors 40 times smaller in area, presenting a number of advantages over IDCs in properties such as focal plane fill factor and mounting architecture, direct absorption, and inter-KID coupling.  There exist two paths in the literature to lower loss: hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (cSi).  Crystalline silicon intrinsically has tan delta < 5e-6, 200 times lower than SiO2 and SiNx.  a-Si:H has been demonstrated with tan delta < 5e-5, not as good as cSi but still 20 times better than SiO2 and SiNx.  We will pursue the development of both options due their complementary advantages and challenges. While a process has already been demonstrated for 5 um cSi with delta < 1e-4 and consistent with other design/fabrication constraints, it has not been shown yet that this can be extended to more convenient 1 um and 2 um thicknesses.  a-Si:H has been demonstrated to have tan delta < 1e-4, but the fabrication recipe is almost certainly machine-specific and may not be compatible with focal plane array fabrication due to adhesion or stress issues. Given the uncertainties and different constraints imposed by the two processes, it is sensible to pursue both.  This development would contribute to filling the Critical Technology Gaps identified in the 2016 PCOS and COR Program Annual Technology Reports, specifically the PCOS “Advanced millimeter-wave focal plane arrays for CMB polarimetry” gap and the COR “Large-format, low-noise far-infrared and ultralow noise (FIR) direct detectors” and “Compact, Integrated Spectrometers for 100 to 1000 um” gaps.

301,"High Power, Thermally Optimized Blue Laser for Lidar","To enable widespread and rapid airborne bathymetric lidar to adequate depths in many ocean regions a low-cost, rugged, and high energy pulsed laser source must be developed in the ocean water transmittance spectrum of 450 - 490 nm. The ideal laser source will be high performance for lidar (high pulse energy, high rep rate, short pulse duration) with specific targeted emission spectrum to meet ocean water transmittance and filtering requirements. It will also feature low SWaP and a rugged form factor with high reliability for continual use on mobile platforms. No existing laser source can meet these demanding requirements. To address this challenge and meet NASA's lidar source needs, Bridger Photonics, Inc.

Bridger's design will leverage three key innovations proven out in its Phase I effort: efficient, end-pumped, low-quantum-defect architecture; gain crystal design for optimal heat removal; and robust monolithic, alignment-free fabrication. The proposed design would allow for widespread deployment of mobile ocean-penetrating lidar transmitters. Successful completion of this Phase II effort will allow Bridger to demonstrate >10 W of average blue power in a compact, turn-key package.

303,Faint Intergalactic Redshifted Emission Balloon (FIREBALL)-2: Flight Test of Next Generation UV Detector and Spectrograph (Lead Institution),"We have developed and successfully flown a path-finding experiment, for which this is the lead proposal, the Faint Intergalactic-medium Redshifted Emission Balloon (FIREBALL), designed to discover and map faint emission from the Intergalactic Medium (IGM). Our successful science flight in June 2009, proved every aspect of the complex instrument performance, and provided the strongest measurements and constraints on IGM emission available from any instrument.   We are preparing a significantly upgraded experiment, FIREBALL-2, for launch in Fall 2015 at Ft. Sumner, New Mexico. We have made progress in spectrograph, detector, and payload design and development. CNES is providing the spectrograph, gondola, and gondola flight support team. Because of a CNES balloon mishap and funding constraints, support for a FIREBALL launch was delayed from Fall 2013 to Fall 2015. We propose 18 months of bridge funding to support the FIREBALL team that includes two female graduate students and one female Post Doctoral scholar (separately supported by NSF and Caltech Millikan Fellowships).  FIREBALL directly supports NASA Science Plan Objectives to ""Understand the many phenom-ena and processes associated with galaxy, stellar, and planetary system formation and evolution from the earliest epochs to today."" FIREBALL directly addresses four Core Science Questions from the Astrophysics 2010 Decadal Survey (New Worlds New Horizons). FIREBALL provides flight and science testing of new UV technologies directly called out by NWNH as high priority for the next decade as a precursor to a 4-m class UV/optical future mission.   STATUS COMPARED TO 2011 PROPOSAL GOALS.   Our proposal in 2011 proposed a relatively simple modification to the FIREBALL-1 payload, replacement of the fiber integral field unit with a multi-bundle fiber interface, and replacement of the GALEX spare NUV detector with a Gen-2, high quantum efficiency UV photon-counting CCD. The modest scale of these changes allowed us to propose a Spring 2013 launch. The accepted proposal and delayed funding profile led to a slip in the launch of one year to Spring 2014.  Further evaluation of the science requirements for the spectrograph, observational progress by our group at higher redshift, and strategic development of future multiplexed UV spectrometers led us to significantly redesign the FIREBALL-2 payload. We are implementing a multi-slit spectrograph optimized for detecting circum-galactic medium emission around galaxies at a red-shift near 0.7 (using LYα), 0.36 (using CIV), 1.0 (using OVI), or 0.28 (using HeII 1640Å). At the same time the CNES balloon group had a flight mishap that along with budget constraints, along with a decision by CSBF to only support Fall turn-around flights, has delayed the launch from Spring 2014 to a Fall 2015 from Ft. Sumner.   We have made significant progress in the payload design and development and on the Gen-2 de-tector. Key features of the new design include higher angular resolution (improved from 10 arcsec to 5 arcsec) in order to separate galaxy from CGM emission more definitively; a field cor-rector to provide high resolution images over a 30 arcmin field; a multi-mask multislit unit with slit masks selectable during flight; a fast, wide field Schmidt spectrograph; a windowless spec-trograph/detector design which minimizes Cerenkov background; a flight detector cryocooler that will be a pathfinder for satellite detector cooling systems; spectrograph field rotation com-pensation; a new gondola pointing system that will provide significantly improved pointing con-trol (from 6 arcsec to 2 arcsec).   This proposal provides 18 months of additional funding to complete payload integration, support field operations for a single flight, and provide 9 months of post-flight support for data analysis and science publication.

304,Demonstration of Submillimeter Astrophysics Technology at Caltech Submillimeter Observatory,"Detector technology developments will determine the science product of future astrophysics missions and projects, and this is especially true at submillimeter wavelengths where the science potential is just being unlocked (e.g., Herschel Space Observatory) but instruments are very far from using efficiently each photon arriving at the focal plane of telescopes. Demonstration of prototype detectors on a relatively low-cost ground-based or suborbital telescope is a key step toward their use in a major project. The Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO) provides a unique, powerful, and cost-efficient test bed for proving new submillimeter detectors. Recent ‘success stories’ for submillimeter detectors featured in a space mission, but tested first at CSO, include the Herschel/SPIRE bolometer arrays (employed first in Bolocam at CSO) and Herschel/HIFI SIS mixers (developed for CSO in years prior). Looking ahead, the CSO is an ideal test bed for demonstrating novel submillimeter Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) for wide-field imaging and moderate-resolution spectroscopy, submillimeter wavefront sensing techniques which take advantage of large detector arrays, and potential breakthrough technologies such as broadband quantum-limited parametric amplifiers. Near-term science application targets include the Cerro Chajnator Atacama Telescope (CCAT), and longer-term mission targets are SPICA, Millimetron, SAFIR/CALISTO, SPIRIT and SPECS.  The following are the objectives of this project:(1) Demonstration of 1600-element Kinetic Inductance Detector (KID) imaging array operating at 350 micron with near background-limited sensitivity, a critical development step for the Short Wavelength Camera (SWCam) on CCAT;(2) Demonstration of 400-element KID imaging array operating at 850 micron with near background-limited sensitivity, also a critical development step for CCAT cameras;(3) Phase-contrast wavefront sensing at 850 micron with improved sensitivity and accuracy, targeting the eventual measurement of the CCAT telescope surface. The current worldwide state-of-the art for submillimeter imaging detectors is the U.K.’s SCUBA2 instrument, which has 5000 Transition-Edge Sensor (TES) detectors each at 450 and 850 micron. TES’s work well, but may have reached practical limits for a ground-based project in part due to the high detector cost (> $100/pixel).  KIDs, on the other hand, should achieve a detector cost of <$10/pixel in the medium term and are therefore the baseline for CCAT’s short-wavelength camera SWCam, which requires 50,000 detectors. KIDsmanufactured at JPL have shown background-limited performance in the lab at 350 micron, and a 400-element first-generation prototype was tested at CSO in April 2013 (see Figure) with promising results. The SWCam detectors operate by absorbing radiation directly in the inductive element of a TiN film and are fabricated by remarkably simple lithography. 350 micron is the key band for CCAT, and the SWCam detector work to date has concentrated on this band.  By re-optimizing the detailed design according to the operating background power, KIDs can work at fundamental background-limited sensitivity limits over a wide range of applications. Given that 850 micron is also an important band for CCAT, we propose to test an 850 micron imaging KID array at CSO in FY14.In FY12 and FY13, JPL and Caltech demonstrated the first (to our knowledge) implementation of phase-contrast (or Zernike) wavefront sensing applied to a submillimeter telescope (see Figure). In this approach, the detector images the power distribution incident on the pupil (primary mirror), and the phase of the field from a point source is modulated in the image plane in order to map the wavefront in the pupil plane. The resolution in the wavefront mapping improves as the number of imaging elements available grows. The testing demonstrated basic operation of the wavefront sensor, with induced ~π/4 wavefront shifts over ~3% of the telescope surface detectable in a few minutes. This testing has been done so far at 850 micron with the (aging) SHARC2 instrument that was not originally designed for operation at that wavelength. One should be able to do much better with an improved detector.

305,Laboratory Studies of Dissociation Recombination with Cold Molecular Ions for Diffuse Cloud Studies by NASA Astrophysics Missions,"We propose to advance our understanding of how diffuse atomic clouds transition to diffuse molecular clouds, an important first step in the star formation process. Observing this transition is challenging as H2 lacks a permanent dipole moment, making direct detections extremely difficult. Also, the commonly used H2-surrogate CO is readily photodissociated in diffuse clouds. We will improve the community's ability to use OH+, HCl+, and ArH+ to trace out the astrophysical properties of this transition. These molecules enable us to measure in diffuse clouds the cosmic ray ionization rate of atomic H, to infer the molecular hydrogen fraction, to constrain the far-ultraviolet interstellar radiation field, and to use proxies to trace out the difficult-to-detect H2 molecule and infer H2 column densities and masses. Using OH+, HCl+, and ArH+ to trace out the properties of diffuse clouds requires an accurate understanding of the underlying gas-phase astrochemistry controlling the abundances of these molecules. Key to this are reliable rate coefficients for dissociative recombination (DR) of electrons with OH+, HCl+, and ArH+. Accurate quantum mechanical calculations are lacking due to the theoretical and computational challenges of handling the many-body systems and the infinite number of intermediate states involved. Laboratory measurements are the only reliable means to generate the needed DR data. But previous experimental work is of limited use due to the moderate to high levels of internal excitation of the molecular cations (typically ~300-1000 K), which is much hotter than diffuse cloud temperatures. We will carry out the first DR measurements for OH+, HCl+, and ArH+ with internal excitations of ~10 K, generate DR data suitable for astrochemistry, incorporate these data into diffuse cloud models, and investigate the astrophysical implications of our new chemical data. The DR measurements will be carried out using the recently commissioned heavy ion Cryogenic Storage Ring (CSR) which is located at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics (MPIK) in Heidelberg, Germany. No other facility in the world is capable of carrying out the proposed DR measurements. Furthermore, we will investigate the astrophysical implications of our new DR data using astrochemical models which we have developed to interpret diffuse cloud observations. For data management, we will publish our findings in refereed journals. The data behind the figures and tables in our papers will be made available electronically through supplementary material provided with the published papers. Our research into diffuse clouds addresses NASA's Strategic Goal 1: ""Expand the frontiers of knowledge, capability, and opportunity in space"". The expected advances in knowledge from our work meets NASA's Strategic Objective 1.6: ""Discover how the universe works, explore how it began and evolved, and search for life on planets around other stars"". Our findings will thereby enable us to address the Science Goal of NASA's Science Mission Directorate Astrophysics Division, namely ""[e]xplore the origin and evolution of galaxies, stars, and planets that make up our universe"". Specific NASA missions that our proposal is relevant to include: Herschel Space Observatory, Hubble Space Telescope, Infrared Space Observatory, Kuiper Airborne Observatory, and Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy.

306,Miniature Lightweight X-ray Optics for Solar System Exploration,"X-ray observations of planetary objects provide a unique window on fundamental processes associated with the formation and evolution of individual bodies and the Solar System as a whole. Future X-ray observations for planetary science require a sensitive yet compact X-ray imaging spectrometer that can operate in in-situ missions. The proposed new type of Miniature X-ray Optics (MiXO) can finally bring highly successful Wolter-I X-ray optics to planetary science within affordable mass, power, and cost constraints.    The elemental composition of planetary bodies is of fundamental interest to planetary science and to understanding the origin, evolution and future of life in the Solar System. X-ray fluorescence, induced either by solar X-ray flux or impacting energetic ions, carries a decisive signature of surface elemental composition. X-ray observations in the 0.1-15 keV band are a unique, powerful diagnostic tool since they cover K or L-shell fluorescence lines from all but three elements, from life essential light elements to rare earth heavy elements. X-rays from solar wind charge exchange enable probes of the dynamic and energetic interaction between comets, planetary exospheres and the influence of solar wind plasma upon planetary surfaces. The proposed optics offer flexible and affordable observing opportunities and enable efficient X-ray telescope configurations that can identify the elemental composition of a wide range of planetary bodies from asteroids and comet nuclei to airless planets and satellites. High resolution imaging with MiXO can not only identify small regions with abundant organic or unusual elements but will also allow straightforward comparison between the elemental distribution and the surface topology, which can reveal the system's evolutionary and geological history such as crater-induced sub-surface grain exposure or localized volatile depletion. As X-rays are emitted from the planetary bodies through a variety of other physical processes, applications of the proposed technology reach far beyond the study of elemental composition.    This program proposes to build three prototype MiXO modules, bringing the technology from TRL 2 to 4 by its end. MiXO inherits the progress in electroformed Nickel replicated (ENR) Wolter-I optics in the past two decades and utilizes new metal/ceramic hybrid technology using Plasma Thermal Spray (PTS) to achieve lightweight X-ray optics. Its efficient light collecting capability exceeds the performance of alternative approaches in planetary science such as micro-pore optics (MPO) by a large factor (>~3). In addition, MiXO enables high angular resolution (<30 arcsec) over a wide field of view (>1 deg), improving the detection sensitivity of surface features by an order of magnitude relative to MPO. MiXO also extends X-ray imaging to higher energies (up to ~15 keV) for detection and mapping of heavy elements. The modular design of MiXO can be easily scaled from low-cost Explorer-class to small Discovery or medium class New Frontiers missions. For Flagship missions, the proposed technology will open a door for powerful, cost-effective X-ray optics that are sensitive enough to distinguish between different organic species and thus detect astrobiological evidence in Europa.    The experts in X-ray optics and telescope systems, who have been the force behind the advances in ENR X-ray optics technology, will lead the technical efforts. The prominent planetary scientists and astrophysicists will also join the efforts to guide the MiXO design optimization for planetary science. The proposed three year plan will not only demonstrate the technical feasibility and advantage of MiXO by building progressively higher performance prototypes of MiXO, but it will also enable several MiXO designs that can be readily adopted in a wide range of future planetary missions. MiXO will make a quantum leap in realizing the full potential of future planetary X-ray observations.

307,An Ultrabroadband THz Heterodyne Receiver With Reduced Cryocooling Requirements,"Laboratory terahertz (THz) heterodyne receiver with advanced capabilities that will be a prototype of the future instrument receiver for application in high-resolution spectroscopy of interstellar gaseous clouds. The new capabilities, which will be brought during this work, are the operation at around 4.7 THz (an important [OI] line), the extension of the intermediate frequency bandwidth of the THz heterodyne receiver up to at least 10 GHz (current state-of-the-art is < 4 GHz), and the possibility to operate a receiver at 20 K (current state-of-the-art is 4 K). These important capabilities have become available due to the use of a new superconducting material for fabrication of the THz hot-electron bolometer (HEB) mixer. HEB mixers are the only mixer type working with low noise at THz. The new material, magnesium diboride (MgB2), has a critical temperature of nearly 40 K. THz spectroscopy is an important tool for studying star formation and evolution processes. JPL has been very strong traditionally in this astrophysical area, with major contributions in both science and instrumentation. JPL has delivered mixers and local oscillators (LO) for Bands 5,6, and 7 THz heterodyne receivers on HIFI/Herschel. JPL also works with University of Arizona on a heterodyne receiver array for Stratospheric THz Observatory (STO-2), a balloon project, and on the Gal/Xgal U/LDB Spectroscopic/Stratospheric THz Observatory (GUSSTO) for NASA’s MO Explorer Program. A heterodyne instrument is an option on a future Origins Space Telescope to be proposed to the 2020 Astrophysics Decadal Survey. The new capabilities, which will be brought during our work, are the operation at around 4.7 THz (an important [OI] line), the extension of the intermediate frequency bandwidth of the THz heterodyne receiver up to at least 10 GHz (current SOA is < 4 GHz), and the possibility to operate a receiver at 20 K (current SOA is 4 K). These important capabilities have become available due to the use of a new superconducting material for fabrication of the THz hot-electron bolometer (HEB) mixer. HEB mixers are the only mixer type working with low noise at THz. The new material, magnesium diboride (MgB2), has a critical temperature of nearly 40 K. Our current R&D work has produced thin-film MgB2 mixer devices with a very high thermal relaxation rate that determines the large IF bandwidth. The expected impacts of the MgB2 HEB mixer technology on the future missions and program are very significant. The MgB2 material allows one to operate the mixer at a temperature as high as 20 K with a small sensitivity penalty. This temperature can be achieved in a relatively inexpensive way using well-developed space qualified mechanical cryocoolers. In this way, a space mission lifetime can be dramatically increased. The Herschel’s mission lifetime (< 4 years) was limited by the capacity of the liquid He tank on board. Another impact is the increased IF bandwidth which will be now sufficient for capturing Doppler broadened spectra from multiple molecular clouds even at the higher frequencies of interests. Also during this work we are going to bring in a novel LO source based on the Quantum Cascade Laser (QCL). The QCL LO can be narrow tuned in the 1.5-5 THz range and operate at 50 K or even higher temperature depending on the frequency. The emitted power is close to 1 mW that is more than order of magnitude greater than the power available from the highest frequency JPL developed 2.5 THz sources based on Schottky-diode frequency multipliers. There are currently no 4.7 THz LO sources at JPL.

308,High-Efficiency Continuous Cooling for Cryogenic Instruments and sub-Kelvin Detectors,"Although large, diffraction-limited telescopes are approaching a size limited by available launch vehicles, there is still an enormous “discovery space” open to astrophysics through the use of advanced low temperature instruments and deep sub-Kelvin detectors. These devices offer the potential for orders of magnitude improvement in sensitivity and spectral resolution. In the past, cryogenic instruments have been large, expensive, and power hungry, consisting of complex cooling chains with multiple coolers using different technologies. High cost and complexity have been the major impediment to the selection of missions using these advanced capabilities. We propose to develop a compact cooling system that will span more than a factor of 200 in temperature, lifting heat continuously at temperature below 50 mK and rejecting it at over 10 K, simplifying the overall cryogenic system. The device, based on Adiabatic Demagnetization Refrigerators (ADRs), will have high thermodynamic efficiency. The prototype system will exceed the requirements of all currently conceived cryogenic detector arrays, including those for flagship missions such as the Far-IR Surveyor, Inflation Probe, X-ray Surveyor, and possibly HabEx and LUVOIR. In particular, it will have more than 5 times the cooling power at 50 mK than previous sub-Kelvin coolers, greatly relaxing the requirements on the heat generation in large detector arrays, and simplifying the thermal design of the focal plane assemblies.  ADRs by themselves have no moving parts and produce no measurable vibration, however upper-stage mechanical coolers have been linear piston devices that export significant vibration. Ameliorating the problems due to upper-stage cooler vibrations has contributed to increased costs on recent astrophysics missions such as JWST and Astro-H. By raising the heat reject temperature to 10 K, the proposed sub-Kelvin cooler becomes compatible with recently-demonstrated extremely low vibration mechanical coolers, eliminating this problem for future missions. Furthermore, a complete cooling chain with extremely low vibration will enable the use of advanced sub-Kelvin detectors on missions with tight pointing requirements.  Multi-stage ADRs offer great flexibility. In addition to continuous cooling at the lowest temperatures, the prototype will have a stage that provides enough power at 4 K to cool a modest sized telescope. This stage could be scaled up to cool a large (multi-meter) telescope. Continuous stages could be added at other temperatures to provide cooling to, for example, Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) arrays for Transition Edge Sensors (TES) or High Electron Mobility Transistors (HEMT) for Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKID).  Now is the time to pursue this effort. Our team recently completed the end-to-end design, build, and on-orbit qualification of the ASTRO-H ADR. Launched successfully in February 2016, the ADR now provides a stable 50 mK on-orbit detector array temperature. In September 2015, our team demonstrated a laboratory ADR that provided cooling at 4 K and rejected heat to 10 K. We are presently building continuous ADRs with heat rejection at 4.5 K that have much higher cooling power per unit mass than the traditional, ASTRO-H style “single-shot” ADRs. In short, the team is now ready to make this technology mission-selectable by 2020.  At the conclusion of this work, NASA will have a TRL-6 magnetic cooling system ready for missions in the coming decades.

309,Design and Development of High Gain AlGaN Avalanche Photodiode Arrays,"Future NASA earth science systems and missions, specifically those involving high resolution Lidar measurements, will benefit from the development of large-area, high gain AlGaN ultraviolet avalanche photodiodes (UV-APD) arrays operating at room temperature at the 355 nm wavelength. The high quality GaN/AlGaN UV-APD detector arrays are epitaxially grown using an optimized metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) technique. The use of lattice-matched bulk GaN substrates provides low dark/leakage current by minimizing defects from the substrate, while alternately AlN substrates can be used to provide backside-illuminated, high fill factor UV-APD devices. In addition to low dark current noise, the solid-state UV-APD devices demonstrate high quantum efficiencies with very high avalanche gains (>10^5). For the Phase II SBIR effort, we shall model, design, develop, and demonstrate the AlGaN UV-APD array technology for implementation in future NASA missions. We will work with NASA for modelling UV-APD arrays for performance improvements in NASA Earth Science systems. Magnolia will collaborate with Prof. Russ Dupuis of Georgia Tech, an expert in III-N material growth and device technology, for MOCVD growth, fabrication, and characterization of the UV-APD array devices. This will entail the enhancement of surface passivation techniques for further performance improvements, developing high quality, low resistivity n- and p-type contacts, as well as incorporating antireflection coatings. It is expected based on measurement data that these devices can perform in Geiger-mode at ~355 nm with high single-photon detection efficiencies for operation in photon-starved environments. Based in part on results attained from the Phase I effort, the AlGaN-based UV-APD technology can meet and/or exceed system requirements in applications such as high resolution Lidar to benefit NASA systems for advancing future missions

310,"Low-Loss, Low-Noise, Crystalline Silicon Dielectric for Superconducting Microstrip and Kinetic Inductance Detector Capacitors","Development of technology to use crystalline dielectrics in superconducting spectroscopic sensors operating in the infrared/sub-millimeter wavelength range. The technology is expected to help enable Physics of the Cosmos and Cosmic Origins mission needs. Prospective future PCOS (Inflation Probe) and COR (FIR Surveyor, FIR Interferometer) missions require large arrays of highly sensitive millimeter-wave and submillimeter (mm/submm) detectors, including spectroscopic detectors. A number of JPL-pioneered technology developments in superconducting sensors for these applications require low-loss dielectric thin films. Examples include: 1. superconducting phased-array antennas (such as those used in the BICEP2, Keck Array, BICEP3, and SPIDER suborbital CMB polarization receivers and the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory’s MUSIC multiband camera), which rely on superconductor-dielectric-superconductor microstrip transmission line to coherently sum radiation received by arrays of slot dipole antennas and to define spectral bandpasses; 2. superconducting spectrometers (SuperSpec), which use such microstrip to route optical power to detectors and to define spectral channels; 3. and kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs), which use capacitors. In the above, the loss of the dielectric, quantified by the loss tangent, is critical: it determines the optical loss in the microstrip, the resolution of spectral channels, and the two-level-system (TLS) dielectric fluctuation noise of the KID capacitor. Currently, amorphous dielectrics (SiO2, SiNx, amorphous hydrogenated silicon (a-Si:H)) are used because they are most convenient for fabrication. They have loss tangent ~ 10-3. Crystalline silicon has loss tangent < 5x10-6, 200 times lower. Incorporating it into microstrip and capacitors would result in a quantum leap in capability, opening up design space heretofore inaccessible and enabling design innovations. The reliability of crystalline silicon would also improve fabrication uniformity and robustness. Specific impacts on the above technologies would be: a) For phased-array antennas, lower optical loss would allow the detectors to be moved away from the antenna and shielded from absorption of light that has not been spatially or spectrally filtered by the antenna and bandpass filters. Doing so would also simplify detector wiring by obviating long wiring busses from the edge of each chip to each detector. More sophisticated antenna designs, such as multiscale antennas that could cover a decade of spectral bandwidth, could be entertained. b) For superconducting spectrometers, lower loss would improve the spectral resolution limit, Rmax = (1/loss tangent), from 10-3 to 2x10-5, sufficient for resolved extragalactic mm/submm spectroscopy, where intrinsic line widths are  ~ 10-4 to 10-3. c) For KIDs, the interdigitated capacitors (IDC) currently used could be replaced by parallel-plate capacitors 40 times smaller in area, presenting a number of advantages. Currently, these IDCs can be an appreciable fraction of or even dominate the focal plane area. In KIDs for imaging at 350 µm (MAKO), it has been necessary to introduce the complexity of a microlens arrays to focus incoming light on the small active region of the detectors. In KIDs for mm/submm spectroscopy (SuperSpec), the large IDCs render the array of KIDs so large that the spectrometer devices must be fabricated on individual chips and oriented normal to the focal plane rather than placing them in the focal plane, creating packaging challenges and degrading the scalability of the design. Furthermore, in KIDs for these purposes as well as coupled to phased-array antennas (e.g., the CSO MUSIC instrument), the IDCs act as unintended antennas that route incoming sub/mm power directly to the detector, circumventing the desired spatial filtering of the received light and increasing susceptibility to stray light. In the example of SuperSpec, the solution has been to require the detectors be hidden behind feedhorns, even though this again degrades scalability. IDCs also can yield inter-KID coupling that can confound the frequency-domain multiplexing that makes KIDs a compelling detector array technology.

311,Stakeholder Web-based Interrogable Federated Toolkit (SWIFT),"The chief innovation is the development of a Predictive Query Language that populates databases with future information provided from aviation models, along with integration to social media networking to augment research, with an overarching web-based system for finding and generating aviation-oriented research questions. The innovation is intended to aid stakeholders in their analysis of current trends and future concepts, and to show its utility we propose using the toolkit to investigate the Trajectory-Based Operations concept, in particular how the future state of the NAS as predicted by the federated models will be different with TBO than without it. NASA is interested in enhancing system capacity by using existing aviation assets more efficiently or by expanding capacity through new technology or smart infrastructure planning. One aspect that is key to this idea is the involvement of the stakeholders, in particular the airlines and the traveling public. Stakeholder involvement is key to many FAA programs, and stakeholders are often represented during NASA programs. Increasing stakeholder involvement, and including the traveling public in some of the projects, will help focus NASA research energy towards high-impact areas that are likely to result in earlier concept implementation. In addition, NASA is interested in using existing models more effectively, allowing past investment on models to yield future returns. The proposed PQL is a large step in that direction. The proposed SWIFT program enables answering vital questions about existing projects as well as providing the stakeholder involvement to enhance new projects. The concept is to integrated existing models and insights from social media into a web-based tool that allows stakeholders (including NASA) to ask and answer �what if� questions about various topics easily and conveniently. The insights provided by the answers will help guide stakeholder decision making.

312,"Large format, high dynamic range UV detector using MCPs and Timepix4 readouts","Large area microchannel plate (MCP) detectors have been identified as the leading candidates for upcoming NASA UV missions such as LUVOIR and HabEx. MCP detectors combine noiseless photon counting with good UV quantum efficiency, high spatial resolution, low intrinsic background and resistance to radiation damage. The large size of the instruments proposed for the focal planes (e.g. the Large Ultraviolet Multi-Object Spectrometer, LUMOS) require very large format detectors that must accommodate a very high dynamic range to handle the spectra from distant galaxies to nearby FUV bright B stars. Recently, MCPs have been fabricated in very large formats (200 x 200 mm). Much of the excellent imaging performance of these detectors is made possible by various types of readout anodes, which either utilize charge division or charge propagation time to encode the position of each event (e.g. Cross Strip [XS], Cross Delay Line [XDL] readouts) and associated electronics that determine the position of the incident UV photon.    Over the past decade, our group at the Space Sciences Laboratory at Berkeley has been developing a new type of MCP readout based on the family of read out integrated circuits (ROICs) developed at CERN called Medipix/Timepix. The pixelated (256x256) Timepix ROIC can sample the MCP charge clouds to determine event centroids. Because the sampling pixels are small (55 micron), the amplifier noise is very low (<75e- rms) allowing a very low MCP gain (~50,000) to achieve spatial resolutions on the order of the MCP pore spacing. Since all the pixels are independent, this resolution is independent of the number of readout ROICs used to support larger MCPs. Unfortunately, the original Timepix and its successor, the Timepix3, could only be abutted on 3 sides, the fourth side used for I/O wirebonds. Therefore only 2xN arrays of these 17 x 14mm chips could be used, limiting the area of such an MCP detector, so it was never proposed for use in the large format NASA applications mentioned above. However, the Timepix readout has been used in many of our detectors in the field, specifically 2x2 arrays for a 28x28mm readout for neutron detection in many neutron beamlines around the world.    The latest generation of this family of ROICs is the Timepix4 (Tpx4), which has many new features that make it an excellent candidate for large format MCP detectors. The Tpx4 is four times larger in area (28 x 25 mm), still with 55 microns pixels (512x448 array). It is also abuttable on 4 sides, allowing unlimited tiling of a mosaic. This was enabled by “through chip via” technology, negating the need for wirebonds, as all signals and power can come from the rear side of the chip. The Tpx4 has an event driven readout, with the capability of 250MHz event rate per chip, well beyond the high rate requirements of any proposed NASA mission.  Finally, the Tpx4 can be operated in an ultra-low power mode such that a future array of 7 x 8  (196 x 196 mm) Tpx4 chips could be operated for less than 28 Watts.    The Tpx4 design by the CERN Microelectronics Group is currently in its final stage and is expected to be submitted for fabrication in late spring with the first dies to be tested by the end of 2019. As a founding member of the Timepix4/Medipix4 collaboration, our group has access to the chips along with the expertise of CERN and other collaborators in this joint ROIC development. Our goal is to design and fabricate a 100 x 100 mm MCP detector with a 3x3 array of Tpx4 ROICS, demonstrating its imaging performance in a four-side abutted array of ROICs. This device will be environmentally tested in our thermal/vacuum chambers at SSL as well as our vibration facility. We also plan to test its radiation tolerance, which is expected to be better than the excellent resistance of its precursors. This effort will result in a TRL5 detector that can be scaled to the ultimate design of the 200mm detectors needed for NASA's next generation of UV telescopes.

313,Linear Mode Photon Counting HgCdTe Avalanche Photodiode Arrays for Multi-beam Laser Altimeters,"We propose to develop a 2x30 and a 7x8 pixel linear mode photon counting (LMPC) HgCdTe avalanche photodiode (APD) array for future planetary laser altimeters and infrared laser absorption spectrometers. These new detectors can detect single photon event and are about 100 times more sensitive than the silicon APDs and photomultiplier tubes used in current laser altimeters in space. The higher sensitivity and pixelated detectors will enable us to increase the number of beams by a factor of 10 compared to the current multi-beam laser altimeter, such as the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) without increasing the laser power. The spectral response of these new detectors spans from 0.4 to 4.3 micrometers, which broaden the choice of laser wavelengths to enable penetrating atmosphere at one of the spectral transmission windows of certain planetary bodies, such as Titan. The new detectors can also be used in atmosphere backscattering lidars and laser absorption spectrometers with near quantum limited performance. These detectors are based on the recent HgCdTe APD technology developed by DRS Technologies supported by the NASA Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO). We have already developed a prototype device with 2x8 pixel in a micro cryo-cooler. Here we proposed to develop a mid-sized LMPC HgCdTe APD array for multi-beam laser altimeters with at least 10 times more beams than the current technology and pave the way for even larger pixel arrays for future 3-D imaging lidar. 	Laser altimeters, or lidar, have been used in numerous space missions to measure surface topography, global shape, orbit, and surface reflectance at the laser wavelength. Early planetary laser altimeters, such as the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA), used a single laser beam to measure the surface elevation profile one per orbit. LOLA is the first multi-beam laser altimeters and shows the great benefit and potential of multi-beam measurements. Besides a much finer and denser ground coverage, it measures the surface slope and roughness from a single laser pulse. It also gives orders of magnitude more cross-over points for orbit and laser beam pointing determination. However the number of laser beams are now limited by the detector sensitivity, size, and the available laser power. The LMPC HgCdTe APD arrays which we propose to develop will have single photon sensitivity and combine individual detector packages into a focal plane array (FPA) to enable a LOLA sized instrument to have 10 times more beams. The United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has already funded DRS after NASA ESTO to produce a large size focal plane array (FPA) but with a simplified read-out integrated circuit (ROIC) for ground-based flash lidar demonstration. We will leverage these investments to develop and demonstrate a 2x30 and a 7x8 pixel array detector (60 and 56 pixels) with full pulse waveform outputs. We will also study the use a single laser with microlens array to illuminate ground surface in a pattern that matches the detector pixel format.       Our work plan is to (a) develop a 2x30 and a 7x8 pixel LMPC HgCdTe APD FPA with ROIC for single photon sensitivity linear outputs; (b) integrate the FPA in a low-cost liquid nitrogen Dewar system and characterize the detector performance; (c) investigate the signal waveform processing techniques that are efficient and can later be integrated in the ROIC, and (d) develop a laser transmitter beam formation technique to match the detector pixel patterns. The entry TRLfor the detector and the laser transmitter are TRL-2. We propose a 3-year research and development program to bring them to TRL-4. The target applications are multi-beam laser altimeters and atmosphere backscattering lidar for Mars and other planetary bodies, mid-wave infrared laser spectral absorption lidar for the Moon and asteroids, and proximity operation lidar for asteroid mapping and sample returns.

314,A Distributed Resilient Autonomous Framework for Manned/Unmanned Trajectory-Based Operations,"Resilient Ops, working in collaboration with Metron Aviation, Inc., proposes to develop a prototype system for planning Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) trajectories based on user intent and preference information. The system, called DRIFT-UAS (Distributed Resilient Framework for Trajectory Management of Unmanned Aircraft Systems), is intended to support autonomous Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) under Trajectory-Based Operations (TBO). It is composed of algorithms and information-sharing components that enable autonomous trajectory planning while optimizing system-wide objectives such as safety, efficiency, and equity. DRIFT-UAS works for a mixed environment (manned and unmanned aircraft), but special emphasis is placed on Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). The immediate application is primarily targeted at lower-altitude aircraft (below 18,000 feet) but DRIFT-UAS would apply as well to upper altitudes. Using DRIFT-UAS, flight operators and air traffic management iteratively exchange trajectory intent and congestion feedback to develop trajectories that are efficient and equitable, while preserving an aircraft�s autonomy in generating its own trajectories based on its internal objective tradeoffs. The feedback aspect of the DRIFT-UAS architecture separates it from other �evaluators,� i.e., systems that check whether operating constraints are violated given a set of trajectories. Once DRIFT-UAS checks the proposed trajectories against system constraints, it provides each aircraft with information via a price update on levels of congestion and system constraints in space and time that would enable the aircraft to revise its trajectory if required. This two-way communication between aircraft and air traffic management on trajectory intent and feasibility results in better trajectories as well as clearer guidance to airspace users as to which trajectories are most likely to be available.

315,A Thermal Imaging Instrument with Uncooled Detectors,"In this proposed work, we will perform an instrument concept study for sustainable thermal imaging over land with uncooled detectors. We will define the science and instrument requirements and we will evaluate three different uncooled detector technologies, which have been conceptualized by our team (and are presently at low-TRL). We will also build-up and demonstrate the materials characterization infrastructure required for progressing the TRL of a chosen uncooled detector technology. The National Research Council's Committee on Implementation of a Sustained Land Imaging Program has identified the inclusion of a thermal imager as critical for both current and future land imaging missions. Such an imaging instrument operating in two bands located at approximately 11 and 12 microns (for example, in Landsat 8, and also Landsat 9 when launched) will provide essential information for furthering our hydrologic understanding at scales of human influence, and produce field-scale moisture information through accurate retrievals of evapotranspiration (ET). Landsat 9 is slated to recycle the TIRS-2 instrument launched with Landsat 8 that uses cooled quantum well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs) operating at ~43-65 K temperature, hence requiring expensive and massive cryocooler technology to achieve its required spectral and spatial accuracies (Fig. 1). In contrast, we aim to conceptualize and develop a thermal imaging instrument which leverages recent and imminent technology advances in uncooled detectors. Such detector technology will offer the benefit of greatly reduced instrument cost, mass, and power at the expense of some acceptable loss in detector sensitivity. It would also allow a thermal imaging instrument to be fielded on board a low-cost platform, e.g., a CubeSat. In addition, it would enable capitalizing on the greater number of launch opportunities available for launch vehicles like the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Secondary Payload Adapter (ESPA).

316,Supernova Remnant Observations and Dark Matter Searches with Micro-X,"Micro-X is a sounding rocket payload that combines an X-ray microcalorimeter with an imaging mirror to offer breakthrough science from high spectral resolution observations of extended X-ray sources. The design and development of this complicated payload has been an ongoing NASA APRA effort which is finally complete and undergoing integration in preparation for launch in February 2018. This three-year proposal seeks funding for: (1) Support of our NASA and NIST Co-I's for the first flight and for analysis of the flight 1 data, (2) design and implementation of payload modifications to optimize Micro-X for a dark matter search and the second flight of the payload from Australia in 2019, and (3) flight 2 data analysis. The scientific payload consists of a Transition Edge Sensor (TES) microcalorimeter array at the focus of a flight-proven conical imaging mirror. Micro-X capitalizes on three decades of NASA investment in the development of microcalorimeters and X-ray imaging optics. Micro-X offers a unique combination of bandpass, collecting area, and spectral and angular resolution. The spectral resolution goal across the 0.2-3.0 keV band is 4-8 eV Full-Width at Half Maximum (FWHM). A reconfiguration of the payload optimizing for ""grasp"" (Effective Area * Field of View) by removing the mirror and increasing the Field of View (FOV) allows this versatile sounding rocket payload to perform dark matter searches with world-leading sensitivity, as well as studies of the soft X-ray background. Our scientific program for this proposal will focus on supernova remnants (SNRs) and sterile neutrino dark matter. For flight 1, we will observe the Bright Eastern Knot (BEK) in the Puppis A SNR. The spatial extent of SNRs has made high-energy resolution observations with grating instruments extremely challenging. X-ray observations of SNRs with microcalorimeters will enable the study of the detailed atomic physics of the plasma; the determination of temperature, turbulence, and elemental abundances; and to look for evidence of charge exchange and clues to gamma-ray emmission from shock regions. We will continue to advance the technology readiness of TES microcalorimeters while enhancing the science capability of the payload by implementing a series of modifications for the second flight. This entails new higher-resolution detectors and modifications of the payload to allow it to fly without the mirror in a large FOV mode appropriate for dark matter searches and studies of the soft-X-ray background. These modifications for flight 2 enable a unique opportunity for a flight collaboration with the XQC sounding rocket team. The X-ray Quantum Calorimeter (XQC) payload is a wide FOV microcalorimeter spectrometer that has flown five times to study the soft diffuse X-ray background. Our two teams will collaborate on a joint observation campaign to take place from Australia in September 2019. The Galactic Center region is the target of Micro-X flight 2. This observation looks for an X-ray line from the decay of dark matter in the Milky Way. Sterile neutrinos with keV mass are theoretically well-motivated dark matter candidates with such a signal. In addition to a general search in the 1-10 keV band, Micro-X will investigate the presence of an observed X-ray line of unexplained origin at 3.5 keV from the Galactic Center. If it detects this line, Micro-X will be able to determine if its energy is consistent with that of known atomic lines in that energy range. In addition, its flux in the wider FOV of Micro-X can be compared with the XMM claim to help distinguish between a point-source or extended-source origin for such a line. Although the science goals for Micro-X flight 2 do not require the XQC data, a combined data set with two observations of the Galactic Center region will increase the sensitivity of the analysis and offer a unique collaborative flight experience for our graduate students and postdocs.

317,Heisenberg vortex for light-weight refrigeration of liquid hydrogen,"Only 83 years ago Werner Karl Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics. His  work led to the creation of quantum mechanics, the application of which has, inter alia, led to  the discovery of the allotropic forms of hydrogen. Fast forward to today,  and the idea that a device as simple as a tube could allow further space travel than ever before  seems impossible. Yet, this is exactly what the Heisenberg vortex allows. The novel Heisenberg  vortex allows for a completely new strategy for the refrigeration of liquid hydrogen tanks. The  para-orthohydrogen conversion via the Heisenberg vortex consists of a Ranque-Hilsch vortex  tube with catalytic liner and takes advantage of the largest entropy change useful at cryogenic  temperatures. This invention will have a direct impact on NASA TABS 14.1 Cryogenic Systems  technology area. Specifically, this technology will address in-space propellant boil-off. Complex  cryocoolers are currently used for refrigeration due to liquid hydrogen's very low temperature  requirements. But, these systems are heavy, power intensive, and contain many moving parts.  The Heisenberg vortex has the potential to supersede current cryocooler technology resulting in  an efficient, reliable refrigeration system with no moving parts and lightweight characteristics.  This advance is directly relevant to the Evolvable Cryogenics (eCryo) and the Advanced  Cryogenic Evolved Stage (ACES) projects. This project will be a continuation of the great  NASA relationship established here at the HYPER Lab and Washington State University.

318,Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors for High-Data-Rate Deep-Space Optical Communication,"High data rate deep space optical communication (DSOC) links for manned and unmanned space exploration have been identified by NASA as a critical future capability, enabling advanced instruments, live high definition video feeds, tele-presence, and human exploration of Mars and beyond. Adopting optical communications promises a ten-to-one-hundred-times increase in data rates from deep space for equivalent spacecraft mass and power as compared to state-of-the-art deep-space Ka-band RF communication systems. One of the key enabling technologies for DSOC is a large area photon counting ground detector array. This array has been identified as a top priority in NASAs technology roadmap (as technology area 5.1.1). To minimize the resources consumed on the spacecraft, it is essential to have the best possible single photon counting detectors on the ground. Therefore, the ground detectors should be efficient (a large fraction of the incident photons should be registered as counts) with low jitter (indeterminacy in the photon arrival time), high maximum count rate, and low false count rate. Ground detector arrays capable of supporting Gb/s links from Mars and beyond are within reach, but still require further technological development. To address this need, the Space Technology Mission Directorate Game Changing Development program office has supported a DSOC technology development project at JPL to realize these goals using kilopixel arrays of tungsten silicide superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (WSi SNSPDs). To minimize the mass and power required on the spacecraft, future DSOC links will be encoded using pulse-position modulation (PPM). In PPM schemes, the maximum data rate achievable is ultimately limited by the timing jitter of the ground detector. While some NbN SNSPDs have demonstrated 25 ps jitter, they also have much lower detection efficiency and SNSPDs have not yet been developed which simultaneously achieve near-unity detection efficiency and 10s of picoseconds of jitter. Furthermore, we do not yet understand the fundamental limits to which the jitter of SNSPDs can be reduced.  For my doctoral research at MIT, I will investigate the fundamental mechanisms of jitter in SNSPDs and engineer unity efficiency detectors with significantly reduced jitter. This will allow a dramatic increase in the fundamental data-rate limit in DSOC links. A key element of my project plan is numerical simulation coupled to nanoscale characterization. By creating more accurate models for SNSPD behavior and coupling these models to microscopic characterizations of actual nanowires I will be able to understand and then engineer jitter in these devices.

319,Monitoring the High-Energy Radiation Environment of Exoplanets around Low-mass Stars with SPARCS (Star-Planet Activity Research CubeSat),"Seventy-five billion M dwarfs in our galaxy host at least one small planet in the habitable zone (HZ). The stellar ultraviolet (UV) radiation from M dwarfs is strong and highly variable, and impacts planetary atmospheric loss, composition and habitability. These effects are amplified by the extreme proximity of their HZs (0.1–0.4 AU). JWST will characterize HZ M dwarf planets and attempt the first spectroscopic search for life beyond the Solar System. Knowing the UV environments of M dwarf planets will be crucial to understanding their atmospheric composition and a key parameter in discriminating between biological and abiotic sources for observed biosignatures. The UV flux emitted during the super-luminous pre-main sequence phase of M stars drives water loss and photochemical O2 buildup for terrestrial planets within the HZ. This phase can persist for up to a billion years for the lowest mass M stars. Afterwards, UV-driven photochemistry during the main sequence phase strongly affects a planet's atmosphere, could limit the planet's potential for habitability, and may confuse studies of habitability by creating false chemical biosignatures. Our proposed CubeSat observatory will be the first mission to provide the time-dependent spectral slope, intensity and evolution of M dwarf stellar UV radiation. These measurements are crucial to interpreting observations of planetary atmospheres around low-mass stars. Mission: The Star-Planet Activity Research CubeSat (SPARCS) will be a 6U CubeSat devoted to monitoring 25 M stars in two UV bands: SPARCS far-UV (S- FUV: 153–171 nm) and SPARCS near-UV (S-NUV: 260– 300 nm). For each target, SPARCS will observe continuously between one and three complete stellar rotations (4–45 days) over a mission lifetime of 2 years. A UV characterization survey of M dwarfs, the most common of planet hosts, is a perfect experiment for a CubeSat: -- UV astronomy cannot be done from the ground because of Earth's atmospheric absorption. -- Photometry of nearby sources is an efficient use of a small aperture. -- Unlike the HST, whose time is shared among many instruments and programs, a CubeSat can provide dedicated space-based long-term monitoring in the UV. Technology: SPARCS will advance UV detector technology by flying high quantum efficiency (QE), UV-optimized detectors developed at JPL. These “delta-doped” detectors have a long history of deployment demonstrating greater than 5x the sensitivity of the detectors used by GALEX. SPARCS will pave the way for their application in missions like LUVOIR or HabEx. Education: The SPARCS research program will train future scientists and mission leaders by mentoring five undergraduate students, three graduate students, and two post-doctoral scholars throughout all aspects of the mission, including engineering, science, data management and outreach. Relevance to NASA: The SPARCS mission will address NASA's goals of identifying the characteristics and distribution of potentially habitable environments, including HZ planet hosts like Proxima and TRAPPIST-1. SPARCS will also be capable of ‘target-of-opportunity’ UV observations of NASA's TESS yield of rocky planets in M dwarf HZs, some of the first HZ planets to be spectroscopically characterized by JWST. SPARCS can provide the needed UV context for the interpretation of transmission and emission spectra of these potentially habitable planets. Further into the future, SPARCS results will inform the target strategy for the enormous telescopic investments in exoplanet science of LUVOIR or HabEx. SPARCS’ technology will fill a gap in NASA's capabilities to observe low-mass stellar/planetary systems in the FUV and NUV. HST's UV capabilities will not last much later than 2019, with future opportunities (e.g., LUVOIR) not arriving until sometime after 2035. The detector technology of this CubeSat will play a crucial role in these and interim UV-capable missions.

320,Precision Foreground Removal in Cosmic Microwave Background Polarization Maps,"The most promising method for detecting primordial gravitational waves lies in the B-mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background, or CMB. A measurement of these B-modes would reveal the first evidence for quantum gravity and determine the energy scale of inflation. However, polarized foreground emission from synchrotron radiation and dust in our galaxys  magnetic field are sources of significant contamination for CMB B-mode polarization maps. I propose to develop high-precision photometric calibration technology in order to make the highest possible quality foreground-cleaned polarization maps of the CMB. I will build and characterize a precision Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) with a novel optical coupling scheme that will enable on-site measurements of Advanced ACTPols  detectors spectral responses. I will develop new anti-reflection coating technology for optical systems to ensure precise calibration. With my calibration in hand, I will then produce foreground-separated polarization maps which will be used to place constraints on inflation, neutrinos and dark energy. The technology I develop will be applicable to all suborbital and space-based CMB, millimeter wave, and submillimeter wave experiments. My work aligns with NASAs  goals outlined in the Science Instruments, Observatories, and Sensor Systems Roadmap (TA08.1.4 and TA08.2.2), Materials, Structures, Mechanical Systems, and Manufacturing Roadmap (TA12.1.4), Physics of the Cosmos Program, and Cosmic Origins Program.

321,Electrolyte Engineering Toward Increasing Nonaqueous Lithium-Oxygen Battery Capacity,"With lithium-ion battery technology reaching its theoretical specific energy limit, electric vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, spacecraft and spacesuits alike require a breakthrough battery electrochemistry to unlock new range and capabilities. Among the beyond Li-ion  battery chemistries studied to date, the nonaqueous lithium-oxygen battery has the highest theoretical specific energy. Critical scientific challenges prevent the realization of this high specific energy, however, including the insulating nature of the electrochemical discharge product, lithium peroxide. As lithium peroxide forms in the battery, it passivates the battery cathode, leading to low ultimate cell capacities. As a graduate student researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, I recently published work on the ability of an appropriately selected anion to increase solubility of the electrochemical intermediate to lithium peroxide formation, lithium superoxide (LiO2), by lowering the free energy of the lithium cation (Li+) in solution. I showed this increase in lithium superoxide solubility enhanced a different lithium peroxide growth mechanism, circumventing the passivation issue and increasing battery capacity. The effect of anion-induced solubility is limited, however, by the already low free energy of Li+ in solution. As a next step, I hypothesize that the addition of appropriately selected non-Li alkali metal cations to the electrolyte in nonaqueous lithium-oxygen batteries will enhance LiO2 solubility more so than the anions I previously studied by lowering the free energy of O2- in solution, resulting in a larger increase in battery capacity. To test this hypothesis, I plan to build laboratory-scale lithium-oxygen batteries containing electrolytes with and without non-Li alkali metal cations, and characterize battery capacity via galvanostatic cycling, lithium peroxide growth via scanning electron microscopy, and lithium superoxide solubility via nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

322,Wide-Bandgap III-V Materials for Multijunction Solar Cell Applications,"My proposal aims to address cost and efficiency issues associated with solar technology for space applications as well as its potential for positive global environmental impacts. The goal of this proposal aligns well with NASA's objectives outlined in the STR TABS for Space Power & Energy Storage (TA03). Three individual but highly complementary research projects are proposed that will culminate in an integration of all three ideas into two demonstrative triple junction solar cells.  For space applications, high specific power is a key requirement for power generation. While some types of solar technology, such as Si single junction, organic, and dye-sensitized solar cells, achieve relatively low cost, they are quite limited in efficiency. Multijunction solar technology can achieve a much larger efficiencies and specific power by stacking solar cells consisting of different bandgap materials to collect a broad portion of the solar spectrum. Multijunction cells are typically made from III-V materials, which are quite expensive relative to alternatives, such as Si and organics. To make this technology more competitive for both space and terrestrial applications, we must lower the cost per watt, which can be achieved either by reducing cost or improving efficiency. The first two projects aim to improve efficiency through the introduction of a wide bandgap top junction to better collect the higher energy photons in the solar spectrum. The two materials proposed to study here are AlxIn1-xP (x=0.36-0.42, hereafter referred to as AlInP) with bandgaps near 2.34 eV and InyGa1-yP (y=0.25-0.37) with bandgaps around 2.15 eV. Although AlInP pn-junctions have not been previously studied for photovoltaic applications, this material boasts the largest direct bandgap of the III-arsenide/phosphides, making it a highly attractive top junction candidate. Conversely, InxGa1-xP has already been studied quite extensively and used in space applications, though only for the x=0.49 composition, as it is lattice matched to commercially available GaAs substrates. Metamorphic InxGa1-xP with x=0.36-0.42 remains largely unstudied, as it is not lattice matched to common substrate which necessitates complex graded buffers to achieve these compositions with minimal strain-induced crystalline defects that can harm solar cell performance. Recent advancements in graded buffer growth techniques have enabled investigation of this promising material. These compositions are of particular interest for their larger bandgaps, and direct absorption processes, similar to AlInP. This proposal seeks to study and optimize the growth conditions and device structures of AlInP and metamorphic InGaP solar cells. The third project focuses on reducing cost through the integration of III-V cells onto Si for its low cost and established manufacturing infrastructure. Previous studies on GaAs0.7P0.3 solar cells grown on GaP/Si templates indicate challenges with extended crystalline defect nucleation upon relaxation of GaP on Si. Here we propose to study the evolution of these defects through GaP solar cell growth on both GaP/Si templates and native GaP substrates. The characterization of solar cell performance and material quality will enable a direct comparison between growth on the two substrates to help determine how these defects nucleate and evolve throughout growth.  All samples will be grown via molecular beam epitaxy. Devices will be characterized for both solar cell performance as well as material quality, the first of which will be determined with lighted and dark current-voltage and internal quantum efficiency measurements. Microstructural characterization carried out with Hall effect measurements, photoluminescence, electron beam-induced current, and atomic force, Nomarski, scanning, and transmission electron microscopies.

323,Enhanced Predictions of Time to Critical Dielectric Breakdown of Materials Under Prolonged Exposure to Space Plasma Environments,"The leading cause of spacecraft failures and malfunctions due to interactions with the space plasma environment is electrostatic discharge (ESD). The enhanced time to ESD model I propose will allow for better predictions of spacecraft lifetimes and reduce the time and effort needed to obtain them. Spacecraft in the space plasma environment accumulate charge over time, the lack of electrical ground and low charge mobility can cause strong localized electric fields to build up in a material that can eventually lead to catastrophic breakdown. As spacecraft with longer mission lifetimes and more sensitive instruments are proposed, it becomes increasingly more important to be able to predict the operational lifetime of materials used in harsh space environments. My research will be to perform material tests in order to develop an enhanced ESD breakdown model.   The Utah State University Materials Physics Group (MPG) has studied the charge transport properties of spacecraft materials in partnership with NASA facilities including Goddard and MSFCs, the JPL and the Air Force Research Laboratory. As part of my participation with the James Webb Space Telescope project, I have studied ESD properties of relevant spacecraft materials. I propose to continue my research in order to develop predictions of ESD, based on descriptions of microscopic defect populations in common spacecraft materials. Of particular interest are spacecraft insulators such as polymeric low density polyethylene, polyimide (KaptonTM), and polytetraflourethylene (TeflonTM) as well as ceramics and glasses such as Al2O3 and disordered SiO2 and potential novel nanodielectrics and metamaterials.  We have identified different defect species in these materials that affect their breakdown behaviors. These defects include thermally-recoverable low-energy defects and irrecoverable defects associated with energetically deep trap sites.  My proposed tests are more applicable to spacecraft technology than standard breakdown tests. Dielectric breakdown strengths cited in handbooks or by manufactures most often come from ASTM standard tests that very rapidly ramp applied voltage until breakdown occurs. These tests are not very repeatable and do not reflect slower charge accumulation rates experienced by spacecraft in the space plasma environment. The MPG ESD test system typically use <1% of these rates, with very repeatable results. For spacecraft charging considerations, it is more useful to talk about how long a material can endure a sub-critical fields before eventual breakdown. The MPG ESD test system is capable of holding samples at sub-critical voltages to observe time to breakdown.  My previous experimental work with ESD and time endurance ESD tests has demonstrated differences in pre-breakdown arcing behavior and post-breakdown transport modes between polymeric and glassy materials. These differences reflect differences in intrinsic and induced material defects. My project will entail further experimental work to confirm differences in density and species of defects in different materials and to relate these explicitly to average times to breakdown under field stress. Critical to the development of this model is the understanding of pre-breakdown arcing in terms of the creation and annihilation of recoverable defect sites and the creation of irrecoverable defects. I will extend the MPG time model in terms of these dual defect modes to predict the time to ESD breakdown of insulating materials across differences in temperature, applied field, and thickness as a function of material defect populations. I will test my model against the MPG spacecraft materials database of ESD measurements and MPG constant voltage conductivity and pulsed electro-acoustic charge transport measurements.

324,Optimizing Materials for Energy Harvesting on Interplanetary Return Missions,"Manned interplanetary missions will only be desirable once the ability to return is established. Even using improved fuel technologies we have not resourced the fuel requirement for return missions to our nearest terrestrial neighbors. Energy harvesting in Outer Space or on another planet is imperative for return mission success, as it is impossible with current Earth-based fuel technologies to supply an outgoing mission to our closest neighbor planets with enough fuel for return. Thermophotovoltaic (TPV) devices, with a theorized maximal efficiency of 85 % conversion of incident sunlight to electricity [1], are ideal for such harvesting. Thus, the work I propose will investigate performance parameters of select TPV materials. Specifically, I will study how the optical absorption, thermal emission, electronic energy conversion and thermal transport properties are related to the structural features of TPV materials in the presence of photon wavelengths abundant in the universe. Through an in-depth, coupled experimental and theoretical, study the relationship between amorphous material structure (i.e., atomic density and fractal dimension) and optical absorption, thermal emission, electronic conversion and thermal transport properties will be determined. The results will establish the governing materials physics to further guide material selection and device design for efficient electromagnetic harvesting cells to be used for constant refuel on interplanetary missions. We will investigate organic semiconducting polymers including but not limited to: PCBM, P3HT, and P3HT:PCBM blend thin films. Due to their small band gaps these materials have an extremely high capacity for absorption in the visible and near-IR spectra, wavelengths abundant on the Martian surface and in interplanetary space. These materials also offer low thermal conductivities and controllable fractal-dendtritic growth [2]. With further improvements to energy conversion efficiency, these amorphous organic materials offer cost-effective and reliable alternatives to current state-of-the-art TPV device materials. Optical absorption coefficients, electronic scattering rates and electronic recombination times will be measured with sub-picosecond optical techniques. The sub-picosecond resolution of absorption and electron scattering rate measurements will offer direct insight into the optical and electronic processes. Emission spectra of the samples will be monitored with optical emission spectrometry. Thermal conductivity and the thermal boundary conductance of the systems will be measured with a sub-picosecond thermoreflectance technique. With these measurements the interplay between the electronic scattering processes and the thermal transport will be evidenced. Temperature dependent measurements will be conducted over the range of 10-1800 K, as facilitated with an optically accessible cryostat. Further, experimental data will be analyzed with atomistic models to develop analytical and phenomenological theories. The atomistic model development will focus on quantum mechanical non-equilibrium Green’s functions (NEGF). NEGF modeling constructs the material from atomic components and is therefore the ideal approach to study the effects of specific structural arrangements on electron excitation, scattering and recombination. The trends determined with the NEGF approach will be directly compared to the trends observed in the experimental data to determine the intricacies in the relationship between atomic arrangement and electronic activity on an atomistic level. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- [1] Harder, Nils-Peter, and Peter Würfel.

325,"Excitonics Based on Carbon Nanomaterials: a Pathway Toward Low-Power, High-Speed, and Radiation-Hard Computation","Power management has emerged as a critical issue that is threatening continued scaling in high-performance metal ""oxide"" semiconductor (CMOS) technology. In particular, charge-based power dissipation is forcing designers to reduce computing performance to mitigate power consumption. Additionally, radiation-induced damage in CMOS field-effect transistor (FET) circuits, which is especially detrimental in military and space electronics applications, has prompted a search for more radiation-hard materials and technologies. Thus, research efforts are focusing on the development of novel, non-FET logic switching devices that are low-power and radiation hard. Due to their zero net charge, excitons (i.e., bound electron-hole pairs) are a focus of continuing research because they have the potential to be utilized for low-power, high-performance switching devices. One-dimensional (1D) carbon-based nanomaterials (e.g., carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoribbons) are a promising platform for these exciton-based devices because they have large exciton binding energies (> 0.1 eV), which could allow these devices to operate at room temperature. Additionally, 1D carbon nanomaterials also possess long radiative lifetimes, can be generated electrically and/or optically, and are inherently radiation-hard. Hence, these excitonic devices have the potential to be the low-power, high-switching, and radiation tolerant nanoelectronic devices necessary to further space exploration. This program will explore, analyze, and optimize electrical generation of excitons, exciton lifetime and stability, exciton transport, and exciton-exciton interactions in carbon-based nanomaterials. Through the use of high purity carbon-based nanoelectronic materials, radiation-hard self-assembled nanodielectrics (SANDs), and integrated optical spectroscopy and scanning probe microscopy we will elucidate the fundamental science and device potential for excitons in low-power, high-performance nanoelectronics for space applications. Specific research thrusts of this project include:  Preparing monodisperse carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoribbons via Density Gradient Ultracentrifugation (DGU).  Integrating SANDs into device geometries that will enhance exciton generation in carbon-based nanomaterials.  Probing and characterizing excitonic phenomena using near-infrared scanning photocurrent microscopy

326,Direct Energy Conversion for Nuclear Propulsion at Low Specific Mass Project,"The project will continue the FY13 JSC IR&D (Internal Research and Development) (October-2012 to September-2013) Travelling Wave Direct Energy Conversion (TWDEC) effort in order to demonstrate its potential as the core of a high potential, game-changing, in-space propulsion technology. The TWDEC concept converts particle beam energy into radio frequency (RF) alternating current electrical power, such as can be used to heat the propellant in a plasma thruster. In a more advanced concept (explored in the Phase 1 NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) project), the TWDEC could also be utilized to condition the particle beam such that it may transfer directed kinetic energy to a target propellant plasma for the purpose of increasing thrust and optimizing the specific impulse. The overall scope of the FY13 first-year effort was to build on both the 2012 Phase 1 NIAC research and the analysis and test results produced by Japanese researchers over the past twenty years to assess the potential for spacecraft propulsion applications. The primary objective of the FY13 effort was to create particle-in-cell computer simulations of a TWDEC. Other objectives included construction of a breadboard TWDEC test article, preliminary test calibration of the simulations, and construction of first order power system models to feed into mission architecture analyses with COPERNICUS tools. FY13 funding constraints resulted in only the computer simulations and assembly of the breadboard test article being completed. The simulations, however, are of unprecedented flexibility and precision and were presented at the 2013 AIAA Joint Propulsion Conference. Also, the assembled test article will provide an ion current density two orders of magnitude above that available in previous Japanese experiments, thus enabling the first direct measurements of power generation from a TWDEC for FY14. The proposed FY14 effort will use the test article for experimental validation of the computer simulations and thus complete to a greater fidelity the mission analysis products originally conceived for FY13. The previous FY13 effort focused on computer simulations of TWDEC physics to build engineering tools with which to design vehicle systems around TWDEC power. The FY13 project also supported initial build-up of a bench-top system for experimental validation of the TWDEC simulations developed. Low specific mass (< 3 kg/kW) in-space electric power and propulsion can drastically alter the paradigm for exploration of the Solar System, changing human Mars exploration from a 3-year epic event to an annual expedition. A specific mass of ~1 kg/kW can enable 1-year round-trips to Mars, regardless of alignment, with the same launch mass to low Earth orbit (350 mT) estimated by the Mars Design Reference Architecture 5.0 study for a 3-year conjunction mission. Key to achieving such a propulsion capability is the ability to convert, at high efficiency and with only minimal losses rejected as heat via radiators, the energy of charged particle reaction products originating from an advanced fission or aneutronic fusion source directly into electricity conditioned as required to power an electric thruster. The TWDEC concept accomplishes this by converting particle beam energy into radio frequency (RF) alternating current electrical power, such as can be used to heat the propellant in a plasma thruster. This project is core to the development of multi-MW power for electric propulsion. The technology developed will enable high power systems which have specific mass in the low single-digits and which are sun-independent, require no neutron shielding, and produce no radioactive waste. The power levels and specific mass this technology could provide will, when combined with either high-efficiency Q-thrusters or VASIMR-class plasma thrusters, enable rapid human missions to Mars and beyond. Project Infusion Path: Low specific mass (a – kg/kWe) in-space electric power and propulsion can drastically alter the paradigm for exploration of the Solar System, changing human Mars exploration from a 3-year epic event to an annual expedition.

While other government agencies and/or industry partners are pursuing aneutronic fusion reactors and plasma propulsion, NASA JSC is the only entity advancing this core energy conversion technology. With successful development of this system by NASA and its partners, an intermediate NASA infusion step would demonstrate megawatt-class aneutronic fusion, TWDEC, and electric propulsion (e.g., Q-thruster, VASIMR) systems on robotic missions to the Jovian moons.

327,A Combined Density Functional Theory and Molecular Dynamics Approach for Quantifying Catalytic Energies in a Liquid Environment,"The primary goals of this project are to develop a method for determining the equilibrium concentration of metal catalysts under actual conditions of liquid phase reactions and to use this method to determine the optimal catalyst alloy for a given system based on chemical reaction kinetics using computational simulations. While most previous computational research on heterogeneous catalysis has focused on gas phase reactions on pure metal catalysts, several groups have begun looking at effects of the reaction environment including solvation effects and adsorbate coverage effects.  Studies have been conducted analyzing solvation effects for single adsorbate cases while other studies have analyzed the effects of adsorbate coverage for heterogeneously catalyzed gas phase reactions, and both effects have been shown to be significant independently. However, to date, no group has included both of these effects concurrently.  The proposed project aims to develop a method to efficiently analyze the simultaneous effects of solvation and adsorbate coverage on each other as well as the reaction energy.	 This study will be accomplished by using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) implementation of Density Functional Theory (DFT) to calculate the interaction energies between solvent molecules, coadsorbed molecules, and adsorbed reactants. These interaction energies will then be used to determine the equilibrium concentrations of the adsorbed reactants. The absorption of these adsorbates into the metal lattice and their subsequent interactions with metal atoms to form metal complexes, which may be more or less catalytically active than the pure metal, will then be studied.  Grand canonical Monte Carlo codes will be written to ensure sufficient ensembles are sampled for all phase equilibria calculations, including absorption and the subsequent absorption of the adsorbate molecules. Finally the equilibrium metal/metal complex composition will be used to determine reaction kinetics parameters for the rate-limiting anode reaction. This will allow for a comparison based on the starting catalyst alloy and enable us to suggest more cost-effective catalyst candidates. The specific system of interest will be the rate-limiting anode reaction of direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs), the oxidation of carbon monoxide by hydroxide to form carboxylic acid, due to the aqueous reaction environment and wealth of previous literature data to compare to simulation results. This work will prove significant because it will yield a method that will be able to yield simulation results that provide a more accurate picture of molecular scale phenomena affecting heterogeneous catalysis. A more accurate molecular level understanding of the catalyzed reaction mechanism will enable the determination of superior catalyst alloys or even non-metal catalyst materials that provide better performance or are more cost effective than current transition metal alloys. NASA has used both hydrogen fuel cells and solid-oxide fuel cells for various applications in past missions, and the method developed here would be able to provide a greater understanding of molecular level phenomena and therefore the ability to develop superior catalyst materials for these fuel cells. This would allow for weight- and space-requirement reduction due to reduced catalyst quantities, as well as superior power output and reduced fuel consumption for these fuel cells. While this project focuses on fuel cells, it will be readily adaptable to any heterogeneously catalyzed reaction system with a fluid feed. Heterogeneous catalysis is also ubiquitous in industrial applications, and the knowledge gained from this project would be easily ported to have a widespread effect by enabling a more comprehensive study of optimal catalyst materials for these purposes.
